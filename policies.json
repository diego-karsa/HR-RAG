    "abandonment-post": "Abandonment of Post    Abandonment of post is a separation initiated by the staff member other than by way of resignation. The intent to separate may be presumed from the circumstances, in particular from the failure of the staff member to report for duty or to make a good– faith effort to perform assigned functions when directed to do so.    The following circumstances may lead to the presumption of the staff member's intent to separate from service:   Absence from his/her work, unless properly authorized as annual leave (AL), special leave with pay (SLWP), special leave without pay (SLWOP), sick leave (SL), or maternity leave (ML), and he/she is not able to give satisfactory proof that such absence was involuntary and beyond his/her control  Seeking or accepting outside employment while on unauthorized absence or extended SL  Failure or refusal to undertake assigned functions unless he/she is able to provide acceptable evidence of inability to do so; or   Failure to report for duty if selected against a vacant post (unless acceptable evidence of his/her inability to report for duty at the new post is provided) within:   30 days if the position is at his/her current duty station, except when a longer period is agreed upon; or   60 days if transfer from one duty station to another is involved, except when a longer period is agreed upon    Entitlements    3.   Separation for abandonment of post does not affect the staff member's entitlement to payment of accrued AL or withdrawal benefits under the UNJSPF. However, the staff member is not entitled to:   A notice of termination  A termination indemnity  A repatriation grant (RG)      Procedures    Supervisors must report all unauthorized absences not later than the end of the fourth day of such absences for:     All staff members stationed outside New York, to the Deputy Resident Representative (Operations), DRR (O); or, in the absence of a DRR (O), to the  Senior HR Advisor serving that office  All staff members stationed in New York, to the OHR Business Partner in Copenhagen serving the organizational unit    The DRR (O), Senior HR Advisor, or OHR Business Partner should then endeavour to contact the staff member concerned by telephone or by any appropriate means, failing which a written communication should be addressed to the staff member at his/her last known address, requesting him/her to report for duty or provide an acceptable explanation for his/her absence. In cases of possible illness, the DRR (O), Senior HR Advisor, or OHR Business Partner should call the staff member's attention to UN Staff Rule 6.2.     Unless the DRR (O), Senior HR Advisor, or OHR Business Partner receives a medical certificate or an acceptable explanation for the absence within six working days of unauthorized absence, he/she should address a further written communication, by registered mail, personal delivery, or other appropriate means, calling the staff member's attention to the earlier attempts to contact the latter and the absence of an appropriate response. The communication should remind the staff member of the provisions of UN Staff Rule 5.1(e) (ii) under which payment of salary and allowances will cease for the period for unauthorized absence. It should allow a further period of up to ten working days for reporting to duty or submission of a medical certification or acceptable explanation and should warn the staff member that failure to do so would be considered abandonment of post and would lead to separation on that ground.     It is the responsibility of staff members to keep the Organization informed of their current address and the person to be notified in case of accident or emergency. If, despite due diligence on the part of the Organization, the staff member cannot be reached or contacted either in person, by registered letter, or other reliable form of communication to the address most recently provided by the staff member, or through family or friends, receipt of such notice will be deemed to have occurred. Refusal to accept a registered letter or a personal delivery will be considered to be evidence of delivery.    If, by the end of the specified period, the staff member has failed to comply with the warning to report for duty or provide an acceptable explanation or medical certificate, a recommendation to separate the staff member from service for abandonment of post will be submitted for:   Local staff members stationed outside New York, by the DRR (O) or the Senior HR Advisor to the Resident Representative or the Head of Office (applicable to European duty stations), for review and decision  International staff members stationed outside New York, by the Resident Representative or the Head of Office to the OHR Business Partner serving the duty station, who will review the case and forward it to the Director, OHR for decision   International or local staff members stationed in New York, by the OHR Business Partner in Copenhagen serving the organizational unit, who will review the case and forward it to the Director, OHR for decision    If the staff member reports for duty within the period specified in any warnings issued, the separation action may be cancelled. The staff member may, however, be subject to reprimand or to disciplinary measures.     Claims for Absence for Reasons of Health     Where a staff member claims that his/her absence is the result of incapacity for reasons of health, his/her attention should be called to the provisions of UN Staff Rule 6.2 (f), which require the production of a certificate from a duly qualified medical practitioner stating the nature and probable duration of the illness.     If the staff member fails to produce such certification or if the certification produced is not acceptable to the UN Medical Service Division (UNMSD), and SL is not certified, the officer will immediately advise the staff member that SL has been refused and that the staff member must report for duty immediately or be separated for abandonment of post.    If the staff member disagrees with the UNMSD’s decision, he/she may request that the matter be referred to an independent practitioner or to a medical board. The medical board shall consist of the following members:   A medical practitioner selected by the staff member  The UN Medical Director or a medical practitioner designated by the Medical Director   A third medical practitioner, who shall be selected by agreement between the other two members and who shall not be a medical officer of the UN    The fees charged by the medical practitioners selected for the medical board shall be paid either by the Organization or partially by the Organization and partially by the staff member. If the original decision is altered in favour of the staff member, the Organization shall bear all medical fees and incidental expenses. However, if the original decision is sustained, the staff member shall bear the medical fees for the medical practitioner whom he/she selected and one half of the medical fees and expenses of the third medical practitioner on the board. The balance of the fees and expenses shall be borne by the Organization.     Pending a final decision following the report of the independent practitioner or medical board, the period following the date of notification that SL has been refused will be treated as non-payable, in accordance with paragraph 9 of Annex I to the UN Staff Regulations.    Whereas the certification of SL falls within the competence of the UN Medical Service, the determination as to whether the staff member had a valid excuse for failing to submit evidence of incapacity or a reasonably acceptable explanation for the absence within the prescribed or reasonable time-limits lies for:   Local staff members stationed outside New York, with the Resident Representative or the Head of Office  International staff members stationed outside New York, with the Director, OHR   International staff and local staff members stationed in New York, with the Director, OHR    Abandonment of Post Following Annual or Special Leave     16.  If a staff member has been absent from duty on approved annual or special leave and has failed to report for duty after expiration of the approved period of leave, the supervisor must report the matter to the DRR (O), Senior HR Advisor, or OHR Business Partner, who will proceed on the same lines as indicated above.     Separation Action     Upon approval of separation for abandonment of post, the DRR (O), Senior HR Advisor, or OHR Copenhagen HR Specialist concerned will process the separation action and will notify the staff member at the address most recently provided by the latter, advising the latter of the decision and indicating the effective date of separation.     The effective date of separation will be the date of the decision of the Resident Representative, Head of Office, or OHR Director to treat the staff member’s conduct as abandonment of post or the date of expiry of his/her fixed-term appointment, whichever comes sooner.     Under UN Staff Rule 5.1 (e) (ii), annual leave (AL) may not be used to cover unauthorized absences.     ",

    "annual-leave": "Annual Leave    Annual leave is granted by UNDP to provide staff members with periods of time off from work at full pay for personal reasons and for purposes of health, rest and recreation.     Subject to the exigencies of service, staff members are expected to exercise their leave within the period in which it is earned.    Eligibility     3.   All staff members with appointments governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules are eligible for annual leave from the date of their appointment.     Accrual and Use     Rate of accrual    Full-time staff: Eligible full-time staff receive annual leave credit at the rate of 2.5 days for each full month of service, or six weeks per year.     Part-time staff: Staff members in part-time employment (i.e. 50 percent of the normal workweek) accrue 1.25 full days per month or 2.5 half days per month.     While on sick leave with full pay or special leave with full pay: When calculating annual leave, service time includes time spent on sick leave with full pay or special leave with full pay (SLWFP).     Maternity leave or special leave with full pay following adoption or paternity leave: Except as indicated in the paragraph below, annual leave is also accrued during periods of:   Maternity leave;  SLWFP for adoption leave purposes; or   SLWFP for paternity leave purposes.     Non-accrual of leave    8.  Annual leave does not accrue during or with respect to the following:   Periods of unauthorized absence;   Periods of suspension from duty without pay unless this period is later reinstated;   Periods of special leave with half pay or without pay for one month or longer;   Periods of sick leave with half pay, unless full pay status is maintained by having each half day of sick leave combined with one half day of annual leave or one half day of work;   Periods in which the staff member receives compensation equivalent to salary and allowances for a service-related injury or illness under Appendix D to the UN Staff Rules;   Periods in which a fixed-term appointment is extended solely to enable a staff member to utilize an entitlement to:   Sick leave;   Maternity leave;   SLWFP for adoption — i.e. adoption leave; or   SLWFP for paternity purposes — i.e. paternity leave; and   In cases of payments for the following:   Accrued annual leave;   Lump sum in lieu of notice;  or   Termination indemnity.   Use    Annual leave may be taken in units of days and half days.     In calculating the leave to be charged, any absence of more than two hours but less than four hours (excluding the lunch hour) is counted as a half day’s leave; similarly, any absence of more than four hours (excluding the lunch hour) is counted as one day’s leave.     Annual leave is subject to exigencies of service and must be authorized in advance by the supervisor, except where a compelling circumstance makes this impossible.     Planning and Leave Requests    Leave planning    Advance planning of leave is essential to ensure that the office can operate efficiently at all times and allow as much notice as possible for staff members to arrange their own leave plans.    Whenever possible, home leave should be taken in conjunction with reassignment and other official travel.    How to charge annual leave    Annual leave is charged only in respect of working days, as defined at the staff member’s duty station.   One day for each journey of less than 10 hours;   Two days for each journey of 10 hours or longer but less than 16 hours; and   Three days for each journey of 16 hours or more.     Additional details on this and other interactions between travel time and annual leave can be found in administrative instruction ST/AI/2006/4 and ST/AI/2006/4 Amend.1. Additionally, it is imperative to refer to the home leave and family leave policies for the specifics governing each.    Payment of Unused Annual Leave     Eligibility requirements     16.  Staff members with appointments governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules who, on separation from service, have accrued annual leave, will be paid for each day of unused annual leave, up to a maximum of 60 days for FTA, CA, and PA, and 18 days for TA contract holders.    Re-appointment following separation     17.  For those staff members who are re-appointed within 12 months of separation from a previous appointment, Staff Rule 4.17 (c) stipulates that the separation for the second time will be adjusted in such a way that the total payments for the first and second separation do not exceed amounts which would have been paid had the service been continuous. Therefore, any payment that the staff member may have received for accrued annual leave during the first separation in the UN Common System will be taken into account if the staff member was re-employed in the UN Common System within one year and then eventually separated. (Example): A staff member worked for the UN and on separation was paid 32 days of accrued annual leave. If re-employed by UNDP within a period of 12 months, this staff member may only receive payment of up to 28 days of accrued annual leave on separation from UNDP.     Authorized and Unauthorized Absence     Authorized absence     18.  Reasonable absences from work due to certain circumstances are not charged to annual leave. These include, but are not limited to:   Taking medical examinations required by UNDP;   Taking official tests or examinations given or required by UNDP;   Voting in a national election;   Court duty; and   Time off during the workday for nursing mothers to breastfeed their infants (see relevant policy).    Office closure in severe weather     If the office closes as a result of severe weather and disruption of transportation systems, UNDP applies the same arrangements as the UN regarding absence of staff. The arrangement may vary depending on the degree and duration of the situation; however, the following general conditions apply:     Staff will not be charged annual leave during the period the office is formally closed;     Essential staff who are required to report to work when the office is closed will be granted compensatory time off for the hours worked;     Staff who were on sick leave, previously authorized annual leave or other leave status should continue to be charged against their leave entitlements;     When the office re-opens, staff who are unable to report to work because of the continuing transportation difficulties and ongoing state of emergency may not be charged annual leave for the first day the office re-opens. Compensatory leave is not payable to those who do report to work; and     Subsequent days will be treated as normal workdays despite the general difficulties that some staff continue to face. Absences on those days will be charged to annual leave, or other leave as appropriate.     Unauthorized absence     No salary is paid to staff members during periods of unauthorized absence from work, such as absences due to strikes, demonstrations or other job actions. A staff member may be liable to disciplinary measures or separation for unauthorized absence.    At duty stations where the workweek is five days, annual leave is charged in increments of days and half days, equal to the actual number of days taken.     At duty stations where the workweek is more than five days, annual leave is charged for the actual number of days taken up to five days, and a full week of annual leave is counted as five days only, as per the illustration below:     Official Duty during Leave    24.  If a staff member is required to perform official duties while on annual leave, the periods during which the official duties are performed are not charged to annual leave. However, any official duties performed while on annual leave must be approved by the staff member’s head of office/unit, in consultation with the office where the duties are to be performed.     Monthly Credit upon Appointment/Separation     25.  Monthly credit for annual leave is affected by the staff member’s date of appointment and date of separation, as follows:          Uncertified Sick Leave     26. Annual leave is charged once the number of uncertified sick leave days exceeds the limitations allowed without producing a certificate from a qualified medical practitioner. The limitations for uncertified sick leave are seven days within each year.    Certified Sick Leave     27.  Sick leave that is reported during a period of annual leave, home leave or family visit will be charged to annual leave unless such illness is certified by a qualified medical practitioner and a request for approval of sick leave together with a medical certificate is submitted immediately upon return to duty.     Home Leave and Family Visit     28. Leave spent on home leave or family visit is charged to the staff member’s annual leave balance, except for allowable travel time.     Transfer of Annual Leave Balance     A staff member who is transferred, seconded or loaned to another organization carries his/her accrued annual leave credit to the receiving organization. The annual leave entitlement of the staff member concerned is governed/administered as follows:   Transfer or secondment: governed and administered by the rules of the receiving organization; and   Loan: governed by the rules of the releasing organization, but subject to administrative control by the receiving organization.    If a staff member on transfer, secondment or loan to another organization is separated from service, any payment of unused annual leave is subject to the following:   Transfer or secondment: the maximum specified by the rules of the receiving organization; and   Loan: the maximum specified by the rules of the releasing organization.    A staff member who returns to the releasing organization brings with him/her any accrued annual leave credit as of the date of return.     Resignation     Staff members are expected to perform their duties during the period of notice of resignation, except when the resignation takes effect on completion of the following:  a) Maternity leave;   SLWFP following adoption — i.e. adoption leave;   SLWFP for paternity leave purposes — i.e. paternity leave;   Sick leave; or   Special Leave    Annual leave may be approved during the period of notice of resignation only for brief periods and subject to the exigencies of service.     Government or Military Service     34. Staff members who are granted SLWOP for government or military service have their accrued annual leave retained as a credit towards the date of return to duty.     Daily Subsistence Allowance while on Official Assignment     35. A staff member who takes annual leave while travelling on official UNDP business may claim Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) for up to 1.5 days of annual leave for each completed month in travel status, provided the annual leave is not taken at the conclusion of active duty immediately prior to the staff member’s return to the official duty station. (Example): If a staff member completes two months on travel status, DSA may be claimed for three days of annual leave, provided the staff member returns to the travel status location following completion of the annual leave.     Maternity Leave     When an appointment is extended solely to enable a staff member to utilize her maternity leave entitlement, this extension does not give rise to any further entitlement to salary increment, annual leave or home leave.     Annual Leave accrued during Maternity Leave period will not need to be exhausted if the Maternity Leave period is immediately followed by a period of SLWOP.    Adoption Leave     38. When an appointment is extended solely to enable a staff member to exercise SLWFP for adoption purposes, this extension does not give rise to any further entitlement to salary increment, annual leave or home leave.     Paternity Leave     39. When an appointment is extended solely to enable a staff member to exercise SLWFP for paternity leave purposes, this extension does not give rise to any further entitlement to salary increment, annual leave or home leave.     Maximum Accumulation of Annual Leave     40. The following limits to the accumulation of annual leave are strictly observed. Staff should monitor their leave balance, plan in advance and utilize their leave entitlement accordingly to avoid forfeiting any excess balance beyond the annual cut-off date.     Cut-off Date: 31 March     41. Staff members administered under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules may carry over no more than 60 days of accumulated annual leave beyond 31 March of any given year. As of 1 April, any days of accumulated annual leave in excess of 60 days are forfeited.     Advance Annual Leave    42. By authorization of the RR/head of office, a staff member may, in exceptional circumstances, be granted advance annual leave up to a maximum of 10 working days provided that his/her service is expected to continue for a sufficient period to accrue the advance leave . If the staff member takes more than the maximum 10 working days that may be granted as advance leave, the entire period in excess of the accrued annual leave is to be considered SLWOP.    Travel Time on Home or Family Leave    43. For travel on an outward and return journey on a home or family visit, staff members shall be granted a fixed amount of travel time not chargeable to annual leave, determined on the basis of the most direct flight available as follows:  One day for each journey of less than 10 hours;  Two days for each journey of 10 hours or longer but less than 16 hours; and  Three days for each journey of 16 hours or more.

    "career-transitions": " Policy on Career Transitions   Purpose  The purpose of this policy is to contribute to the governance / management of UNDP’s workforce, foster and leverage diversity, and promote career development, specifically by governing the management of UNDP staff who are going through career transitions, including:  Staff who are transitioning in or out of UNDP under the Inter-Organization Agreement concerning the Transfer, Secondment or Loan of Staff among the Organizations applying the UN Common System of Salaries and Allowances (referred to for the purposes of this policy as ‘the Agreement’);   Staff on rotational posts who are being reassigned and are waiting to take up the new assignment;  Staff who are unassigned as a result of a change process, return from an interagency move, return from secondment to the Development Coordination Office (DCO) , return from special leave with or without pay, or who fail to meet the requirements of the Mobility policy.   Applicability  The Policy applies to all International Professional (IP) staff members holding a UNDP Letter of Appointment and hired on Fixed-Term Appointments (FTA) and Permanent Appointments (PA), referred to for the purposes of this policy as ‘staff members’.  The Policy does not apply to staff members holding UNDP Letters of Appointment for service limited to another UN entity. It also does not apply to staff hired on Temporary Appointments (TA) or personnel working for UNDP under any other contractual modality.  From the date of entry into effect of this policy, all staff members who are the subject of new outgoing interagency moves will be provided with new terms of return in accordance with this policy. For existing interagency moves already in progress, the new terms of return can either be applied at any time with the agreement of all parties, or in the event of an extension to the existing agreement.    Staff members going on secondment or loan will be made aware of the provisions of this policy before the start of such secondment or loan.   Interagency moves  The Inter-Organization Agreement concerning the Transfer, Secondment or Loan of Staff among the Organizations applying the UN Common System of Salaries ad Allowances is an instrument signed by several organizations of the UN Common system that establishes the rights of a staff member of one organization who is transferred, seconded or loaned to another organization, and the rights and liabilities of the two organizations concerned. The agreement provides the following modalities:  Transfer: Movement of a staff member from one organization to another under conditions which give the staff member no right to return to the releasing organization.  Secondment: Movement of a staff member from one organization to another for a fixed period, normally not exceeding two years, during which the staff member will normally be paid by and be subject to the staff regulations and rules of the receiving organization, but will retain his or her rights of employment in the releasing organization. The period of secondment may be extended for a further fixed period by agreement among all the parties concerned. Secondments are generally granted with a general lien to the organization.  Loan: Movement of a staff member from one organization to another for a limited period, normally not exceeding one year, during which the staff member will be subject to the administrative supervision of the receiving organization but will continue to be subject to the staff regulations and rules of the releasing organization. Depending on the agreement with the receiving organization, the receiving organization will either reimburse UNDP for all costs related to the loan or UNDP may agree to the loan being non-reimbursable, meaning that all costs related to the assignment are borne by UNDP. Loans for six months or will normally be granted with a specific lien to the position of the staff member. For longer periods approval is normally granted on a general lien basis.   These modalities do not apply to organizations who are in the United Nations system and have not signed the Agreement.   Application of modalities governing inter-agency mobility  Decisions on the modalities listed in paragraph 6 above to be applied in individual cases will be approved by the Director OHR and taken on the basis of the following considerations: the interests of the organization, career aspirations of the staff member, promotion of diversity and inclusion, and agreement of the receiving organization. The mobility of staff members taking up or holding a post of Resident Coordinator will be governed by the provisions of paragraphs 21 and 22 below.  Transfers  Staff members who have applied for and intend to accept an offer of employment from a UN organization that is a signatory to the Agreement will normally be transferred to that organization.  Transfers have no expectation of return and are initiated by the staff member interested in pursuing their career outside of UNDP.  UNDP will seek the approval for a transfer by the receiving agency after receiving the corresponding official request. If the receiving organization does not agree to transfer, or UNDP refuses to apply one of the remaining modalities, the staff member will be required to resign from the organization in order to take up their new post at the Organization outside of UNDP which they seek to join. In order to promote reciprocity of staff transfers between organizations, the same provisions will normally apply in reverse to staff members coming from other UN organizations that are signatory to the Agreement who are intending to accept an offer of employment from UNDP and are not requesting a secondment from the releasing organization.  Secondments  Only PA holders, and FTA holders who have served with UNDP for five years or more and whose performance is satisfactory at the time the inter-agency move is requested can be considered for a secondment, unless an exception is granted by the Director of OHR. The maximum duration of a secondment is two years, which may be extended exceptionally with the agreement of all parties, for two additional years. Secondments should only be used for staff who are expected to return to UNDP, following the completion of the agreed term or earlier.  There are two categories of secondments, those in the interest of UNDP and those in the interest of the staff member.   Secondments in the interest of UNDP:  Where UNDP deems that a staff member is moving in the interest and at the request of UNDP to a UN organization that is a signatory to the Agreement for a limited period not expected to exceed two years and who is expected to return to UNDP at the end of this period, they may be seconded to that organization in the interest of UNDP.   In case of a secondment in the interests of UNDP, the staff member may be offered a specific lien to their post.  In this case, the staff member will have to return to UNDP at the end of the period of secondment. Failure to do so will result in the loss of the specific lien. The organization reserves the right to change a specific lien to a general lien on extension should the reasons for secondment change. The release of a staff member with a specific lien will be made in consultation with the releasing unit. The releasing unit can make use of the mechanisms available within UNDP policies to cover the gap, such as detail or short term assignments.  Secondments in the interest of the staff member:  Where a staff member is moving at their own request (for example, to further their career in line with UNDP’s career framework) to another UN organization that is a signatory to the agreement, UNDP may exceptionally approve a secondment in the interests of the individual.    In the case of a secondment in the interest of the staff member, they shall be provided with a general lien to UNDP.   Loans  In exceptional circumstances, UNDP may conclude a reimbursable or non-reimbursable loan agreement in order to facilitate the mobility of a staff member. This provision would apply to circumstances where, for example, the receiving organization is not able to create a position within their regular structure and therefore cannot undertake the administrative and contractual processes that are required to operationalize a transfer or a secondment. Loans will generally be approved for a period not exceeding one year, and they may be extended for an additional period if such extension is in the interest of the organization. Loans with a duration of six months or less may be provided with a specific lien to the position of the staff member, with only a general lien in the case of loans of longer duration.   Terms of return in cases of general lien to UNDP  A staff member on secondment or loan can only compete as an internal in a restructuring process if they retain a specific lien to their post, not when on a general lien. During the secondment/loan, staff members with a general lien who apply for UNDP positions will be considered internal applicants for those positions in UNDP and will be considered for those positions for which they meet the eligibility criteria.   Permanent Appointment holders:  The return of a PA holder (on secondment or loan) with a general lien will be conditional on the staff member having been selected for a position with UNDP prior to the end of the interagency move. Such staff members should begin actively searching for suitable vacancies within UNDP and elsewhere in the UN System at least 9 months prior to the scheduled date of return.   If the staff member has not been able to secure a new position prior to the end of the interagency move, which would start immediately after it ends,  the staff member will be automatically placed on search for a period of 60 days prior to the end of the interagency move as specified in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Unassigned Permanent Appointment Holders.  In case UNDP is not successful in appointing the staff member to a position for which the candidate is eligible and suitable, the organization will proceed with termination as specified in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Unassigned Permanent Appointment Holders.   FTA holders  It is the obligation of an FTA holder on secondment or loan with a general lien to obtain a position with UNDP prior to the end of the interagency move if that staff member wishes to remain in service with UNDP. Staff members concerned should begin actively searching for suitable vacancies within UNDP and elsewhere in the UN System at least 9 months prior to the scheduled date of return.   Unless the staff member has been able to secure a new position starting immediately after the end of their secondment or loan, the organization will proceed as follows:  If the end of the secondment/loan is aligned with the contract expiration date, the contract will lapse on that specific date.  If the end of the secondment/loan comes before the contract expiration date, the organization will proceed with consideration of termination at the end of the secondment or loan followed by one months’ notice (if served) or as cash in lieu of notice, as decided by the organization, unless an exception is obtained by the Director, OHR. Basic termination indemnity in accordance with Annex III of the Staff Regulations and Rules will be paid, following approval of termination of appointment by the Director, BMS.   Special conditions for Resident Coordinators (RC), Resident Coordinator Office (RCO) and Development Coordination Office (DCO) staff  Resident Coordinators or staff seconded from UNDP to the UN Secretariat on similar positions (DSRSG, SRSG, HC) will be provided the maximum of two consecutive secondments of two years each, with the extension of an exceptional fifth year, in case the RC assignment is of five years.  All RCs and staff seconded from UNDP to the UN Secretariat on similar positions (DSRSG, SRSG, HC) are seconded on a general lien basis from UNDP.  All international and national RCO staff, and all DCO staff, will be transferred to appointments with the UN Secretariat in accordance with paragraph 9 of this policy.    Reassignment pool  The Reassignment Pool is a mechanism employed by UNDP to assign staff members who are temporarily unable to take up an appointment to a rotational post following the end of their previous assignment (for example, if the new post is not yet vacant or if there is a delay in obtaining formal accreditation from the host country government).   Placement in the Reassignment Pool will be approved by the Director, OHR.  Staff members can be in the Reassignment Pool for a maximum of six months. This may exceptionally be extended for periods of up to six months, subject to the approval of the Director OHR.  Staff members in the Reassignment Pool must be readily available to perform short term assignments as required by UNDP. Some examples of short term assignments for which capacity may be sought through the Reassignment Pool include: project management for special management or development projects; SURGE/rapid deployment assignments; research assignments; and/or ad-interim roles; filling capacity gaps due to extended sick, maternity, paternity and other leaves, and for posts which are being filled but are still vacant due to delays in recruitment; any other short-time assignments where a temporary boost in capacity is deemed of corporate priority and/or where business continuity is essential.   A staff member placed into a short term assignment from the Reassignment Pool will be supervised by the respective manager in the receiving office. They can serve in Headquarters, at the receiving unit's duty station, at the staff member’s home country or last duty station, whichever is most appropriate and economical, as decided by the organization. The staff member will retain their grade during the period of the short term assignment.  The time of the short term assignment is included in the calculation of the maximum duration of the placement in the reassignment pool.   The staff costs during the time a staff member is placed in the reassignment pool will be covered from a special reassignment reserve.   Unassigned staff  Reasons  Staff members are considered “unassigned” when they fail to secure a position in UNDP, including but not limited to the following reasons:  Return from an interagency move: In case the staff member did not secure a position in UNDP and was seconded or loaned with a general lien to UNDP.   At the end of Special Leave Without Pay (SLWOP):  In case the staff member did not secure a position in UNDP and the SLWOP was undertaken with a general lien to UNDP.  Staff on rotational positions at the end of tour of duty: Staff on rotational positions have a tour of duty depending on the duty station where they serve and, as such, may be unassigned if they do not have a new position to move on to before the end of their tour of duty. When undertaking a rotational post, staff members do not have a specific lien on their previous position.   Following completion of a non-rotational assignment: In case the staff member has not secured a position by the end of an assignment.  Mandatory mobility requirement: In case the staff member needs to move to another post in order to fulfil a mandatory mobility requirement and the staff member has not secured such post at the end of the established period.  In case of post abolition: Staff members can also be unassigned as a result of the abolition of their post (due to a change process, end of a project, etc.).    Separation process  PA holders In case a PA staff member is at risk of being unassigned, as defined above, he/she will be automatically placed on a search period, 60 days before the end of the specific arrangement (as defined in 1. above). The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Unassigned Permanent Appointment Holders establish the process to follow in this case.  FTA holders  In case an FTA staff member is at risk of being unassigned, as defined above, he/she will be notified of the date when his/her contract will be terminated, in case the end of the period (as defined in 1. above) comes before the normal end of contract date. In this instance, the staff member will be eligible for termination indemnities.    Financial considerations  The costs of the search period (if not served while on interagency exchange or SLWOP), notice period (paid in cash or served), and termination indemnities will be covered from the separation reserve.

    "certificate-service": "Certificate of Service    Any UNDP staff member governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules who submits a request in writing when leaving the service of UNDP is provided a statement relating to the nature of his/her duties and length of service. Upon the staff member's written request, the statement can also refer to the quality of his/her work and official conduct.    Such certificates are distinct from reference checks and responses to inquiries from prospective future employers or from other organizations of the United Nations common system.

    "chartered-medical-evacuation-travel-cmet": "Chartered Medical Evacuation Travel        Chartered Medical Evacuation Travel (CMET) consists of obtaining highly specialized medical air ambulance services together with, as necessary, professional medical services to evacuate a critically ill staff member or dependent. CMET is to be used for the most critical emergencies and when commercial air transportation by the most direct and economical route (the normal mode for MET) is not sufficient to safeguard the staff member’s life.         All Heads of Office should be fully briefed on CMET procedures, have all relevant contact numbers of medical officers, approving officers, International SOS and HQ contacts and are expected to be capable of acting quickly and correctly outside normal working hours.

Chartered air transportation is very costly and should be used very cautiously.         International SOS         6.   UNDP has an agreement with International SOS (SOS), a private provider of emergency services worldwide, for emergency medical evacuations using its chartered air transportation services. A separate and similar agreement is in existence for UNFPA,    UNICEF and UNOPS staff and their eligible dependents. The SOS services are very costly and should be used very cautiously. Normally, the minimum cost per airlift through SOS is between US$50,000 and US$55,000.         Eligibility         Internationally recruited staff members        7.   Internationally recruited staff members with appointments governed under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, their spouses and dependent children residing at the duty station may be evacuated in case of an acute illness or injury for the purpose of securing essential medical care or treatment which cannot be secured locally because of inadequate medical facilities. Internationally recruited staff members, their spouses and dependent children should plan all elective surgical, medical or dental procedures in conjunction with their home leave (HL) or family visit (FV) travel.         Locally recruited staff members        8.   Locally recruited staff members governed under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, their spouses and dependent children for whom the Organization has not assumed a responsibility for relocation to or from the duty station will normally be expected to use the facilities available locally. However, when an acute life-threatening medical emergency occurs, MET will be considered when the available local facilities offer an inadequate response.         Former staff members        Former staff members, including retirees, are not eligible for MET.

Attributability      3.   The provisions of Appendix D apply only where injury, illness, or death is considered by the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims (ABCC) to be attributable to the performance of official duties.

    "danger-pay": "Danger Pay  Definition   Danger Pay is “a special allowance established for internationally and locally-recruited staff who are required to work in locations where very dangerous conditions prevail, comprising the following:   Duty stations where United Nations staff, owing to the very fact of their association with, or employment by, an organization of the United Nations common system, are clearly, persistently and directly targeted or where premises are clearly, persistently and directly targeted, thus presenting an imminent and constant threat to staff and activities;   Duty stations where United Nations staff or premises are at high risk of becoming collateral damage in a war or active armed conflict;   Non-protected environments where medical staff are specifically at risk to their life when deployed to deal with public health emergencies as declared by the World Health Organization.”   Governance  The Chairman of the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) is responsible for approving Danger Pay and promulgating the list of designated Danger Pay duty stations. The list is updated every three months, and can be found at the ICSC website.  Designation of Danger Pay duty stations is made by the Chairman of the ICSC following recommendations by the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (DSS) for locations described in paragraphs 1a) and 1b) above. For locations meeting the criteria of 1c), the recommendations to the ICSC Chairman are made by the Director-General of the World Health Organization.   Eligibility and Duration   Danger Pay is paid for all the days that the staff member is physically present in the designated Danger Pay duty station, regardless of whether the staff member is required to report to duty at a UN office.  Danger Pay is not payable for days spent away from the duty station on any type of leave, or on telecommuting except when staff members are requested by the office to telecommute from a location outside the duty station due to unavoidable circumstances such as footprint reduction or delay in visa issuance; and telecommuting from a location which is also eligible for Danger Pay. Such arrangements should be restricted to the shortest duration possible.  Danger Pay is normally granted for periods of up to three consecutive months. Its application is lifted by the Chairman of the ICSC when dangerous conditions are deemed to have abated.    Payment Modalities and Amounts  Danger Pay is paid as a monthly sum to all staff members, irrespective of the actual number of days in the month.  It is paid when the staff member completes a full month in the designated duty station, with exceptions and conditions specified below.   Internationally Recruited Staff Members  The monthly amount of Danger Pay applicable to internationally recruited staff members is available at the ICSC website. Danger Pay is payable for time away from the duty station on rest and recuperation (R&R) travel (i.e., for seven consecutive calendar days of authorized leave, which includes travel time).  Danger Pay is also payable for time away from the designated duty station on official duty travel up to a maximum of seven consecutive calendar days including weekends and holidays falling during that period.     For periods of less than a month, the amount of Danger Pay is prorated on the basis of 365 days (i.e., the daily rate, which is calculated by dividing the annual amount (the monthly amount x 12) by 365 days, is multiplied by the actual number of days spent at the designated duty station).   Locally Recruited Staff Members   Danger Pay is payable irrespective of whether the staff concerned are required to report to duty.  Staff members on parental, annual, or sick leave continue to be eligible for danger pay for as long as staff members remain in the designated duty station and for time away from the designated duty station on official duty travel up to a maximum of seven consecutive calendar days including weekends and holidays falling during that period.  The monthly amount payable for locally recruited staff members is set by the ICSC for each eligible duty station based on 30 percent of the midpoint of the respective General Service scale in effect in a reference year available at the ICSC website (excluding Long Service or Longevity steps) divided by 12. For absences from the designated duty station as detailed in paragraph 10, Danger Pay is prorated.  The daily rate is calculated by dividing the relevant annual amount by 365.  If staff members are on official duty travel to another duty station that qualifies for Danger Pay, they will receive Danger Pay at the rate applicable to:  Locally recruited staff members at the duty station to which they have traveled, if the destination is located within the country of their duty station; or Internationally recruited staff members if the destination is located outside the country of their duty station.

    "dependency-status-and-allowances": "Dependency Status and Allowances    This policy takes effect on 1 January, 2017 and introduces changes to the former policy on Dependency Allowances and amends the elements of the former definition of a dependent spouse. It also addresses the transitional arrangements from the old compensation package to the new one.  Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria described below, staff members  appointed under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules are entitled to receive allowances for:     A dependent spouse ;  A dependent child (or children);  A dependent child of a staff member considered a single parent; or   A secondary dependent    A staff member must apply and meet the eligibility criteria described below to qualify for payment of the dependency allowances.    Eligibility     Dependent Spouse     Eligible dependent spouse (spouse allowance)     A spouse of a staff member is considered dependent when all the annual gross earnings (gross, before tax) of his/her spouse, if any, do not exceed:     For internationally recruited professional staff members, the gross salary of level G-2 step 1 of the New York General Service (GS) salary scale in force on 1 January of the year concerned, irrespective of the country in which the spouse is employed. OHR will inform internationally recruited staff members of such amount on a yearly basis; and     For locally recruited staff members, the lowest entry level of the GS gross salary scale in force on 1 January of the year concerned for the duty station in the country of the spouse's place of work.     If a staff member is in service or has been married for less than the full calendar year, the spouse's total gross earnings for the full year will be taken into account to determine eligibility in relation to the earnings limit established for that year.     Basis for determining marital status     UNDP recognizes as a staff member's spouse any person who is lawfully married to him or her.    UNDP also recognizes legally recognized domestic partnerships, common law marriages and similar unions between a staff member and spouse that has been validated in reference to the law of the competent authority under which the personal status has been established, as per ST/SGB/2004/13/Rev 1.  UNDP’s acceptance of a person as a ‘spouse’ will not, in any case (common law or another form of union or partnership), preclude further review should a question of an existing prior marriage arise at any time. Nor will it conclusively determine the rights of competing claimants to entitlements as surviving spouses under UN or United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF) Rules and Regulations.     Instances of more than one spouse     For dependency benefits, the UN recognizes only one spouse. Where more than one spouse is legally recognized as validated by reference to the law of the competent authority under which the personal status has been established, as per ST/SGB/2004/13/Rev 1, the staff member may elect which spouse to designate for dependency purposes for the duration of the appointment. Any travel or related entitlements will be in respect of the recognized spouse only. The names of the other (uncovered) spouses are recorded for Pension Fund purposes.     Staff members who are legally separated     A staff member who is legally separated may claim dependency benefits in respect of his/her spouse as long as the staff member continues to provide financial support to him or her and can provide UNDP with proof thereof.     Staff members who are divorced     A staff member who is legally divorced may not claim dependency benefits in respect of his/her former spouse.     Calculation of dependent spouse allowance     Internationally recruited professional staff members with a dependent spouse receive a spouse allowance equivalent to six per cent of net remuneration (net base salary and post adjustment).   Locally recruited staff members with a dependent spouse receive a lump sum payment in addition to their net salary only when local conditions and/or practices of comparator employers call for the establishment of such an allowance. The amount of the allowance, if any, is provided in the local salary scale applicable at the duty station.     Dependent Child  \t    Eligible dependent child     A dependent child is any of the following children under the age of 18 years or, if the child is in full-time attendance at a school or university (or similar educational institution), up to the age of 21 for whom the staff member provides main and continuing support:     A staff member's natural child    A staff member's legally adopted child; and     A staff member's stepchild, if residing with the staff member    Unless disabled, a child over the age of 21 and still in school or university is NOT entitled to the allowance.     If legal adoption of the child is not possible because there is no statutory provision for adoption or any prescribed court procedure for formal recognition of customary or de facto adoption in the staff member's home country or country of permanent residence, then a child in respect of whom the following conditions are met can be recognized as a dependent:     The child resides with the staff member    The staff member can be regarded as having established a parental relationship with the child    The child is not a brother or sister of the staff member    The staff member has permanently assumed full responsibility for the care, education, and upbringing of the child; and     The number of children for which dependency benefits are claimed under this paragraph does not exceed three.     Attendance at a boarding school or a similar educational arrangement is not interpreted as meaning that a child is not residing with the staff member.     Dependent disabled child (special dependency allowance)     A disabled child, for purposes of the dependency allowance, is a child who is physically or mentally disabled either permanently or for a period expected to be of long duration. The UN Medical Director makes the determination of disability on the basis of satisfactory medical documentation.     For internationally recruited professional staff members     A dependent child allowance is payable in respect of each child recognized as a dependent. The yearly amount of the allowance is currently applicable to the staff member’s assigned duty station and is equivalent to the amount  referred to in Annex 1 of ST/IC/2011/6.  Special dependency allowance for disabled children  The dependency allowance for disabled children is:   Double the amount of the dependent child allowance, if the staff member is entitled to receive a dependent child allowance with respect to that child; or  An additional payment in the amount of the dependent child allowance, if the staff member is paid a single parent allowance or a transitional allowance on account of that child.  For locally recruited staff members   For locally recruited staff members:   Where there is no local practice to provide a dependent child allowance, the amount of the allowance is set at 3 percent of the mid-point of the local salary scale; and   Where there is a local practice to provide a dependent child allowance and the allowance has been set according to the local practice, the minimum amount will also be 3 percent of the mid-point of the local salary scale.     The number of children for whom the dependent child allowance is payable for locally recruited staff members is limited to six.     Special dependency allowance for disabled children  The amount for a disabled child, is double the rate of the regular dependent child allowance. However, at those duty stations where a higher amount of dependency allowance is payable for the first dependent child and if the first dependent child is disabled, the staff member receives for that child:     The higher amount of dependency allowance payable for the first child; plus    An amount equivalent to the child allowance payable in respect of children      other than the first dependent child.     When both spouses are UNDP/UN staff members     If both spouses are staff members of UNDP or one is employed by another UN system organization, only one may claim the dependent child allowance in respect of their child(ren). It is normally granted to the spouse receiving the higher salary unless that staff member is employed under a Temporary Appointment.  When a staff member is divorced or legally separated from another staff member, the determination of who will receive the dependency benefit for the child(ren) will be based on the staff members that has legal custody of the child(ren). In the case of shared legal custody, paragraph 24 above, will apply.      Adjustment when a government grant is received     If a staff member, his/her spouse, or any other person receives a dependency benefit in the form of a government grant in respect of a child, the amount is subtracted from the allowance payable by UNDP.     Receipt of a government grant affects the amount of the dependency benefit only, not the dependency status of a child.     Single parent allowance in respect of a first dependent child   Internationally recruited professional staff members shall receive a single parent allowance in respect of a first dependent child when the following conditions are met:  The staff member’s status, is recognized as single by UNDP The staff member is divorced or widowed or legally separated from a spouse The staff member does not reside with the other custodial parent The staff member has a dependent child recognised by UNDP under UN Staff Rule 3.6 (a) (iii) and the criteria set out in the present policy.   A staff member who meets the eligibility criteria of a single parent shall receive the single parent allowance equivalent to six per cent of net remuneration (net base salary and post adjustment), in respect of the first dependent child, in lieu of the dependent child allowance.  Adjustment where financial assistance is received   If a staff member claiming a single parent allowance receives financial assistance from any source in respect of that child, the staff member shall report the total amount of the financial assistance received. Such financial assistance received shall be deducted in full from the single parent allowance payable by UNDP on account of the first dependent child and applied on amounts exceeding the dependent child allowance under paragraph 19).   Receipt of financial assistance affects the amount of the single parent allowance payable by UNDP on account of the first dependent child only, not the dependency status of a child for other purposes under the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules   Secondary Dependent     Eligible secondary dependent     A secondary dependent is a father, mother, brother, or sister for whom the staff member provides at least one half or more of the total financial support and, in any case, at least twice the amount of the secondary dependent's allowance.     The requirements as to age, school attendance, and total and permanent disability that apply to dependent children are also applicable to dependent brothers and dependent sisters.     An allowance for a secondary dependent is not paid where a dependent spouse allowance is paid.     The allowance is payable for one secondary dependent only.     In the case of local staff, secondary dependency allowance is paid only if provisions for this allowance are included in the salary scales for the particular duty station.      Calculation of secondary dependent allowance     Internationally recruited professional staff members with no dependent spouse may receive dependency allowance for not more than one secondary dependent, provided that the conditions specified above are met. The yearly amount of the allowance is provided in the salary scale, which is available here.  Locally recruited staff members receive a dependency allowance for a secondary dependent only when local conditions and/or the practices of comparator employers call for the establishment of such an allowance. The amount of the allowance, if any, is provided in the local salary scale applicable to the duty station.     When both spouses are UNDP/UN staff members     When both spouses are staff members of UNDP or one is employed by another UN system organization, either or both spouses may claim a dependency allowance for one secondary dependent, provided that the conditions specified in paragraphs 32 through 36 are met.    Obligation to Report Changes     Staff members are required to report any change in the status of a dependent that may affect the payment of the respective dependency benefits.  Staff members must immediately notify  their HR focal point responsible for administering their entitlements of any changes in the elements that formed the basis for the eligibility of existing dependency benefits, such as:  Their marital or personal status, including conditions related to recognition as a single parent; The status of their dependents, including all annual gross earnings, financial support or grants received, school attendance and marital status of their dependents, as applicable.  Self-certification  The rimary responsibility for self-certification rests with the staff member. Through the self-certification process, the staff member must attest to the correctness of the information provided in his or her application for dependency benefits and submit documentation when requested to do so.  Claim for payment of the dependency allowance   Payment of dependency allowance is not automatic. It is the responsibility of each staff member to claim dependency allowances for which he or she believes that he or she may be entitled.    Discontinuance and Recovery of Dependency Allowances     Timely and complete submissions will avoid long periods of retroactive recovery in the case of discontinuance of a dependency allowance. This is particularly important when a change in spousal earnings or government grant occurs, or cessation of a dependent child’s full-time studies alters a staff member’s eligibility. In those cases where retroactive recovery is required, the recovery schedule will be:     If the allowances paid relate to a period of less than one year, the recovery will be in three monthly instalments     If the allowances paid relate to a period exceeding one year, the recovery will be in six monthly instalments.     The dependency allowance for spouses will be discontinued only if the staff member indicates that the spouse’s earnings have exceeded the established yearly gross earnings level. If the spouse’s earnings exceed the yearly gross earnings level, it is the responsibility of the staff member to report this by completing and submitting the Dependency Status Form. Staff members who fail to report this change may be subject to disciplinary sanctions.     Government grants    The dependency allowance for children will be adjusted if a government grant has been received in respect of a child. If the amount of the grant changes, it is the responsibility of the staff member to report this by completing and submitting the Dependency Questionnaire (p.84). Staff members who fail to report this change may be subject to disciplinary sanctions.     Children between 18 and 21 years    The dependent child allowance for children between 18 and 21 years will be discontinued if the child has ceased to be in full-time school attendance. If a child has ceased to be in full-time school attendance, it is the responsibility of the staff member to report this by completing and submitting the Dependency Questionnaire (p.84). Staff members who fail to report this change may be subject to disciplinary sanctions.     Children reaching 21 years    The dependent child allowance for children reaching the age of 21 will be discontinued automatically, on the date of the child’s 21st birthday.           Maintenance of Dependency Benefits     Existing staff members who have already filed a claim and receive a dependency allowance are required to complete the Dependency Questionnaire (p.84), annually, to verify their entitlement.     The dependency benefits that the staff member receives will continue until the staff member informs his HR Focal point, in writing, of changes in the composition of their family or any other change affecting his or her entitlement to dependency benefits, signalling that an adjustment in the allowance should be made.     Failure to report a change in dependency status, false certification of the information contained in the Dependence Status Form, or misrepresentation of facts relating to a claim for dependency benefits may lead to disciplinary sanctions.     Staff Members without Dependents     Staff members without dependents are not required to complete the Dependency Status Form. It is the staff member’s responsibility to file a claim for dependency benefits when they believe that they have become eligible.     Transition measures   A staff member who does not receive a dependent spouse allowance or a single parent allowance, and who, on 31 December 2016 received  a salary at the dependency rate in respect of a dependent child, shall receive a transitional allowance equivalent to six per cent of net remuneration (net base salary and post adjustment) from 1 January 2017 onward, in respect of that child, subject to the following conditions:  On 1 January 2017, the child continues to be recognized as a dependent child in accordance with staff rule 3.6 (a) (iii) and criteria set out in Paragraphs 14 to 17; and   The staff member is not in receipt of a dependent child allowance in respect of that dependent child, except for an additional payment on account of a dependent child with a disability as per paragraph 23  (b) of the present policy.   The transitional allowance shall be reduced by one percentage point of net remuneration every 12 months thereafter.  This reduction shall fall due on 1 January of every year and not be suspended for any reason.  Payment of the transitional allowance shall be discontinued when:   the staff member becomes eligible for, and is paid, a dependent spouse allowance or a single parent allowance; or,  the child in respect of whom the transitional allowance is paid is no longer recognized as an eligible dependent child; or,  the amount of the transitional allowance becomes equal to or lower than the amount of the dependent child allowance, provided that, in such case and at such time, the staff member shall be paid the dependent child allowance for that child.  Once the transitional allowance is discontinued, it shall not be reinstated regardless of subsequent changes to a staff member’s personal status and dependents.",

    "eligibility-international-benefits-and-entitlements-and-determination-official-un": " Eligibility for International Benefits and Entitlements and determination of official UN Nationality   In accordance with Staff Rule 4.3 (a), UNDP shall not recognize more than one nationality for each staff member.  Where a staff member holds more than one nationality, UNDP shall determine the nationality of the state with which the staff member is, in the opinion of the Administrator, most closely associated. The determination made by UNDP is not a judgment as to a staff member’s personal identification or sentiment, but rather an assessment of objective factors in the determination of a nationality for the purpose of ensuring  consistent application of international benefits and entitlement in accordance with the purposes for which they were created.  When determining or reviewing a staff member’s recognized nationality for official purposes, UNDP will consider all the relevant circumstances that indicate the nationality with which a staff member is objectively linked, including which nationality was most recently acquired by the staff member.   The recognized nationality or place of permanent residency, as relevant, will be used to determine the staff member’s eligibility for international benefits and entitlements and their place of home leave, in accordance with UNDP’s Home leave policy.  A review of a staff member’s recognized nationality may be conducted by UNDP at any time, including to ensure consistency with UNDP’s benefits and entitlements framework or as a result of changes mandated by a governing body. The acquisition of permanent residency or another nationality subsequent to being appointed as a staff member by UNDP may trigger a review of a staff member’s status, including their recognized official UN nationality and place of home leave.  A staff member who intends to acquire permanent residence status in any country other than that of their nationality or who intends to change or obtain an additional nationality must notify UNDP of that intention before the change or addition comes into effect.  Eligibility for international benefits and entitlements for staff members in posts subject to international recruitment (Staff Rule 4.5)  Depending on their type of appointment, the allowances and benefits available to internationally recruited staff members, may include: payment of travel expenses upon initial appointment and on separation for themselves and their spouses and dependent children; relocation shipment; home leave; education grant; and repatriation grant.  Staff members recruited locally at a duty station for posts in the Professional and higher categories at that specific duty station are considered internationally recruited but are not entitled to the allowances and benefits mentioned in paragraph (a) above, if the staff member is serving in the country of recognized nationality or of home leave. A staff member who has changed their residential status in such a way that they may, in the opinion of the Administrator, be deemed to be a permanent resident of any country other than that of their recognized UN official nationality, or acquires another nationality while employed by UNDP, shall lose entitlement to home leave, education grant, repatriation grant and payment of travel expenses upon separation for the staff member and their spouse and dependent children, and relocation shipment, based upon place of home leave. In such cases, it is considered that the continuation of such entitlements would be contrary to the purposes for which the allowance or benefit was created and will therefore be discontinued.   UNDP applies section 5 of the UN’s administrative instruction (ST/AI/2001/19) which clarifies the application of Staff Rule 4.5 where a staff member obtains permanent residence in the United States while in service. Specifically:   United States permanent resident status   5.1\tPursuant to staff rule 1.5(c) staff members intending to acquire permanent resident status in any country other than that of their nationality or who intend to change their nationality must notify the Secretary-General of that intention before the change in resident status or in nationality becomes final. Such staff members should inform [GSSU-Copenhagen] in writing prior to making their application for permanent resident status or naturalization, as the case may be. 5.2\tIn accordance with United States law, a permanent resident of the United States who is a United Nations staff member may not continue to hold permanent resident status unless within a period of 10 days she or he signs a waiver of the rights, privileges, exemptions and immunities which would accrue to him or her as a staff member of the United Nations.  5.3\tBefore they become United States permanent residents, staff members shall be required by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service to sign the waiver of rights, privileges, exemptions and immunities referred to in section 5.2 above. Such staff members must first request permission to sign the waiver. If such permission is granted and an alien registration card is issued to the staff member, she or he must take it to [GSSU-Copenhagen] to be recorded. Such staff members must also inform the office as soon as possible in writing of the date of the signature of the waiver.  5.4\tThe signing of the waiver by staff members who are already in permanent resident status or acquired it after entry on duty places them in a position of parity with staff members of United States nationality with respect to their United Nations status. While such staff members retain full functional immunities for actions taken in the course of official business, they are otherwise subject to United States laws, including those regarding taxation, payment of customs duties, etc. These staff members become liable for payment of United States taxes on emoluments earned from the United Nations as of the date of the signing of the waiver. Such taxes are subject to reimbursement to staff who have been authorized to sign the waiver pursuant to staff regulation 3.3 (f) and the tax reimbursement administrative instruction.* [ST/AI/1998/1] 5.5\tStaff members who sign the waiver in order to acquire permanent resident status lose any entitlements they would otherwise have had to international benefits under the Staff Rules by virtue of serving at a duty station outside the country of their nationality (i.e., home leave, education grant, repatriation grant), but only from the date on which they are granted permanent resident status as shown on their alien registration card and not from the date on which they sign the waiver.  5.6\tSubject to this section, staff members who have permanent resident status in the United States are required to renounce such status and to change to G-4 visa status upon appointment and staff members who seek to change to permanent resident status will not be granted permission to sign the waiver of rights, privileges, exemptions and immunities required by the United States Government for the acquisition or retention of permanent resident status.  5.7\tThe rule in section 5.6 above does not apply to the following: \t(a)\tStateless persons; \t(b)\tNewly appointed staff members who have applied for citizenship by naturalization, when such citizenship will be granted imminently; \t(c)\tGeneral Service and related categories staff previously authorized to retain permanent resident status, on promotion to the Professional category;  \t(d)\tStaff members in the General Service and related categories; \t(e)\tStaff members appointed to serve outside the United States under [a temporary appointment]; \t(f)\tStaff members appointed for less than one year; however if their appointments are extended beyond one year, that extension is subject to obtaining a G-4 visa.  5.8\tLocally recruited staff members in the General Service and related categories holding permanent resident status in the United States at the time of appointment and wishing to retain this status must produce their alien registration card to [GSSU-Copenhagen] on the day they report for duty.  5.9\tLocally recruited staff members in the General Service and related categories seeking to acquire permanent resident status after appointment must advise [GSSU-Copenhagen] in writing prior to making their application.   This policy will remain in force until amended or revoked by UNDP.   ",

    "experience-and-academic-qualifications": " Experience and academic qualifications  In accordance with Staff Regulation 4.4 that allows for the setting of recruitment standards, this policy details the minimum educational requirements and relevant years of work experience for recruitment of external candidates (including staff joining UNDP on secondment, inter-agency transfer or exchange) and selection of internal staff for vacant positions in UNDP. It also provides guidance on the determination of step-in-grade upon initial recruitment into UNDP.  This policy is applicable for all new recruitments in UNDP including General Service (GS) staff moving into the Professional category.  The e-Recruit online submission and/or Personal History form (P.11) signed by the applicant (including electronic signature) is the official document by which HR practitioners will establish the academic qualifications and determine the number of years of relevant working experience for the purposes of selection and recruitment and for the determination of the step and grade of the selected candidate. ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS AND RELEVANT WORK EXPERIENCE  Combined with academic qualifications are the number of years of relevant work experience required for the grade level of the post. Relevant work experience and minimum academic qualifications form the basis for UNDP’s standard of a professional workforce.  The minimum academic standard for all recruitments and selections to Professional and higher level category posts (IP, and National Officer (NO) is normally a completed, advanced university degree (Masters or equivalent, and also inclusive of professional certifications (CPA etc.) and military/police rank equivalents).  In some instances, where specialized job requirements do not require a Masters’ degree or the local labour market makes it impracticable, UNDP jobs may be advertised without the Masters requirement. In these scenarios, candidates holding a completed Bachelors’ degree with two additional years of relevant work experience may be considered.  This determination must be made prior to advertising the vacancy announcement. There is no longer any possibility to request a waiver of the minimum academic requirements after the vacancy has been advertised with the Masters’ degree or equivalent requirement.  Hiring Managers are accountable for ensuring that similar posts are advertised with similar requirements. It is important to avoid any inconsistencies in the approach to filling posts in order to respect the guiding principles of competition and transparency.  The minimum standard for all support GS is completion of high school (secondary school) combined with a number of years relevant work experience. Selection to GS Fixed-Term Appointment (FTA) positions at Headquarter locations requires passing a UN administered Global General Service Test (GGST), unless conditions are met allowing the waiver of such a requirement.  For GS positions in New York and D.C, the UN GGST test will be waived for current UNDP staff members on FTA/CA/PA appointments and external applicants who have a Bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) from a recognized educational institution.   Applicants under serious consideration for posts requiring accountancy and finance skills must take the UNDP Accountancy and Finance Test (UNDP AFT) prior to short-listing. For recruitment guidance and standards applicable to UNDP finance functions please refer to the Supplemental Recruitment Guidance for UNDP Finance Functions. DETERMINING RELEVANT EXPERIENCE  In determining the number of years of relevant work experience, HR practitioners must take into account any relevant experience gained after completion of the first university degree (Bachelors or equivalent) unless the candidate has undertaken ‘mid-career’ studies, in which case some flexibility may be exercised. Compulsory Military Service completed prior to a first university degree may also be taken into account provided that it is directly relevant to the position being recruited for and may be counted as 50% Full Time Equivalent (FTE). Determination of relevance of Military Service will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  In determining the ‘relevancy’ of experience, HR practitioners will make a determination based on the nature of the functions and the competencies required for the position as articulated in the vacancy announcement, or more generally on experience in the UN Common System.  Full-time consulting experience in the UN Common System, or like-institutions, may be counted at ‘one-for-one’ or 100% Full Time Equivalent (FTE). Formal volunteer work (for example UNV) may also be counted one-for-one. Non-UN Common System independent consulting, non-formal volunteer work, and remunerated teaching while pursuing academic study, in most cases, may not be counted at greater than 50% FTE. Internships are not counted when determining months of relevant experience. RECOGNITION OF UN COMMON SYSTEM PROFESSIONAL SERVICE  In recognition of a candidate currently in, or having previously had a Professional post for more than one year in the UN Common System, UNDP will recognize that service and the candidate will be eligible for consideration for Professional and higher level posts. SUPPORT TO CAREER PROGRESSION OF LOCALLY RECRUITED STAFF  In support of National Staff career progression, a UNDP GS staff in Country Offices with a first level university degree in combination with at least 10 years of continuous service with a FTA /CA/PA may be considered for NO posts that have been advertised with the Masters’ degree or equivalent requirement, provided they meet all other selection criteria.  In support of career progression of UNDP GS staff in Headquarters locations, staff possessing a first level university degree in combination with at least 10 years of continuous service with a FTA/CA/PA, may be considered for Professional posts that have been advertised with the Masters’ degree or equivalent requirement, provided they meet all other selection criteria. ACADEMIC REFERENCE CHECKS  All selected candidates will be required to submit evidence of their academic qualifications and may be subject to academic reference checks. Candidates found to have falsified their academic credentials, or to have submitted qualifications from non-accredited academic institutions (sometimes referred to as ‘diploma mills’) is a basis for withdrawing the offer of employment, or, if the employment has started, to terminate it without notice or indemnity.  The authority to determine whether degrees presented to UNDP by staff members and applicants constitute recognized academic qualifications lies with the Director, OHR. In making such determinations, the Director, OHR, is normally guided by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) listing (referred to as “the UNESCO list” of higher education institutions recognized or otherwise approved by competent authorities in participating countries.  UNDP will normally recognize only degrees obtained from institutions on the UNESCO list, except where the Director, OHR, has explicitly, in writing, confirmed the degree as acceptable. Degrees requiring little or no actual course work, degrees awarded for payment of fees only, and degrees granting substantial credits for “lifetime achievements” or “life/work experience” will not be recognized.  Incomplete degrees are unacceptable to UNDP as proof of academic qualification, regardless of whether they are associated with a recognized higher education institution.  If an academic degree was obtained from an institution that is not in the UNESCO list, the candidates, including internal candidates are obliged to provide supporting evidence that the degree is legitimate. Hiring managers or staff members may request a review by the Director, OHR, who will confirm, explicitly and in writing, whether the degree is recognized. Without proper documentation and until this confirmation is received, no offer of appointment cannot be made to the candidate.  Staff members who, in their P.11 and other application documents, misrepresent their qualifications or present a degree that is determined to be illegitimate, are subject to disciplinary proceedings or any other appropriate administrative action.

An allowance set by the Security Coordinator of the United Nations may be payable to United Nations Common System staff under certain conditions.    The Extended Monthly Evacuation Allowance (EMEA) is applicable when staff members assigned to duty stations designated as non-family duty stations are therefore unable, for security reasons, to have their family members join them. The EMEA was established to alleviate hardships of staff members faced with the inconvenience and cost of maintaining two households and with having to pay rental costs in two locations. Staff members may opt to settle their family either in their place of home leave, previous duty station, or a third country.    The EMEA will apply in cases where duty stations have been designated as \"non-family\" locations and where evacuation extends beyond six months. It also applies in cases where staff are assigned to duty stations already designated as “non-family”.    The amount of EMEA is established by reference to the rental threshold percentage applicable to the duty station where the family is located, according to the method detailed in Annex I of the United Nations Field Security Handbook. See Annex III, Section 20706, for a sample calculation for payment of EMEA. The Office of Human Resources communicates the value of the EMEA for the individuals concerned.    ",
    "family-leave": "Family Leave   The purpose of family leave is to allow eligible staff members a period of time in the event of a family-related requirement. Family leave is a justification for leave, not an additional amount of leave. It expands the acceptable justification for taking uncertified leave without increasing the overall amount of leave.   Eligibility   All internationally and locally recruited staff members governed under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules are eligible for family leave.   Entitlement   Eligible staff members may use all or part of the maximum seven working days of uncertified sick leave as family leave for family-related emergencies. Examples of family-related emergencies are:  In the event of a death in the staff member’s immediate family; or  b) \tTo take care of his/her child or an immediate family member who becomes ill etc.   Loss of Family Leave   When an eligible staff member does not use all or part of his/her uncertified sick leave entitlement, he/she does not receive:  Payment in lieu;  Additional annual leave credit; or c) \tCredit for the next leave year.

Requests to take annual leave for family-related emergencies will be favourably considered.   Combination of half-time work with annual leave    Subject to the needs of the Organization, requests to combine half-time work with annual leave for family-related emergencies will be given favourable consideration. (Example): Instead of taking one week of full-time annual leave, the staff member may request half-time annual leave over a two-week period, combined with half-time work.  Special leave without pay   Subject to the exigencies of service, requests from staff members for SLWOP for a family-related emergency will be given favourable consideration.

    "family-relationships": "Family Relationships    In order to avoid real or perceived family influence or conflict of interest, within UNDP, the Staff Rules provide that, “An appointment shall not be granted to a person who is the father, mother, son, daughter, brother or sister of a staff member”, (Staff Rule 4.7 (a)).     This prohibition applies to the recruitment of individuals at UNDP, irrespective of the type of contractual modality, including Fixed-Term Appointments (FTA), Temporary Appointments (TA), Continuing Appointments (CA), Permanent Appointments (PA), as well as Service Contracts or Individual Contracts (IC). In other terms, if a person who works for UNDP under any contractual modality is the father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or sister of a candidate for a UNDP position under any type of contractual modality, that candidate cannot be appointed as a UNDP staff member or offered a non-staff contract.  United Nations Volunteers are not included in this prohibition, but any family relationships between a UNDP staff member or employee and a UNV must be disclosed when it becomes known.      This prohibition does not extend to a candidate who applies for a position with UNDP under any type of contractual modality and who is related to a staff member of another UN organization.     For individuals who are recruited by UNDP on behalf of another UN entity or who are hired to work for another UN entity under a UNDP administered contract, UNDP will, prior to the recruitment, advise that organization of the existence of the family relationship with the individual already employed by UNDP in the same duty station.      Obligation of the Applicants    All applicants for a UNDP position, in whatever contractual modality, are required to disclose their family relationships with a person already employed by UNDP as staff member or nonstaff. The same applies to applicants for positions in Country Offices and Regional Centres who are related to a person employed by a UN agency working in the same country.     The disclosure is not limited to father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or sister, but also extends to any other family relationships.    The disclosure of family relationships must be made, in writing, in the P11 form at the time of the application. The requirement to disclose family relationships in the P11 form applies to staff  and non-staff positions, as the P-11 form is a prerequisite document for all hiring processes, including staff and non-staff positions.    If the candidate has not disclosed that he/she was related to an individual employed by UNDP in whatever contractual modality and irrespective of the nature of the family relationship, this may constitute a basis for withdrawing the offer of employment or, if the employment has started, to terminate it without notice or indemnity.    Obligation of the Staff Members    Staff members holding a UNDP letter of appointment are required to disclose their family relationship with a candidate as soon as they become aware of his/her application, selection or hiring.      Any changes to a staff member’s family relationship with another UNDP staff member must be disclosed as soon as the relationship is known.  If a staff member becomes aware of the existence of a family relationship – including, but not limited to, mother, daughter, sister, brother, father, or son – of which he/she was previously unaware, he/she should inform the HR Practitioner and the Head of Office immediately in writing. In the case of individuals under other non-staff contractual modalities, he/she should immediately notify the supervisor and the Head of office in writing.    Obligation of the Hiring Unit    The Hiring Unit has the duty to enquire about the candidates’ possible existence of family relationships and to ensure that the candidates provide this information in their P11, updated if necessary.     An individual who possesses one of the six prohibited relationships to a current staff member or employee employed by UNDP may not be shortlisted for a staff or non-staff position in UNDP. If a Hiring Unit mistakenly shortlists such an individual, the recruitment process must be halted immediately upon the discovery of the prohibited relationship. Under no circumstances should an offer of appointment be made to the individual possessing a prohibited relationship.    All Hiring Units are encouraged to exercise careful judgment when hiring candidates who bear family relationships other than the six prohibited with a person already employed by UNDP or when hiring a candidate who bears a family relationship with a person employed by another UN organization, which would create the perception or actual conflict of interest.    The hiring manager is fully accountable for ensuring that no offer of appointment is made to any individual possessing a prohibited family relationship.      Interagency Movement of a Family Member    If an individual is subject to an interagency movement (loan, secondment, or exchange) to UNDP by a UN Common System organization or government, the disclosure of any family relationship to a UNDP staff member or employee must be disclosed.  Such a relationship would not necessarily prohibit the movement, as long as the parent organization retained administrative rights and the position was not directly in the same line of authority as with the current UNDP staff member.      However, a staff member of a UN agency who bears one of the prohibited family relationships with a UNDP staff member or employee cannot be transferred to UNDP.    Spouses    Spouse: Pursuant to Staff Rule 4.7 (b) and (c) and recognizing the importance of supporting dual careers, the spouse or recognized partner of a staff member may be appointed to a position with the prior review of the Compliance Review Board or Compliance Review Panel and the endorsement by the hiring manager, who each will ensure that he/she:   Is fully qualified for the position for which he/she is being considered  Has been selected in accordance with the UNDP recruitment and selection policy requirements, including a full, transparent and open competitive selection process  Is not given undue preference by virtue of his/her marriage or domestic partnership and  Is not assigned to serve in a position in the same line of authority, in the same organizational unit, or in a manner that might influence or could be influenced by the spouse    The spouse or recognized partner of a UNDP staff member may be appointed to a non-staff position provided that the conditions provided for in paragraph 17 above, from a) to d), are met; the prior approval of the Director, OHR is not required.    Relatives of Heads of Office    Under no circumstances shall a relative, including a spouse, be assigned to, or be recruited under, any other contractual modality in the same UNDP office as the staff member who heads it (e.g.. neither in the same Country Office where the relative is the Resident Representative, nor in the same Regional Centre where the relative is the Regional Director, nor in the same Liaison Office or Headquarters Bureau where the relative is the Director).     ",
    "family-visit": "Family Visit      Purpose      1. Family visit travel provides periodic family visits for eligible staff residing alone at their duty station.      Eligibility       Internationally recruited staff members governed under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules are eligible for family visit travel provided they meet the conditions below.      Family visit travel may be taken under the following conditions:      None of the staff member’s eligible dependents has been present with him/her at the duty station, or in the area of assignment, after travel at the expense of UNDP, other than on education grant travel for the preceding:    12 months if assigned to a duty station with a 24-month home leave cycle; or    six months if assigned to a duty station with a 12-month home leave cycle       The staff member has completed at least:    six months service in a duty station with a 12-month home leave cycle; or    12 months since departure on the previous family visit travel;      Since departure on the last home leave, the staff member has completed at least:    six months of service at the duty station if assigned to a duty station with a 24-month home leave cycle; or    three months if assigned to a duty station with a 12-month home leave cycle;       Since departure on the last family visit, the staff member has completed at least:    24 months of service at the duty station if assigned to a duty station with a 24-month home leave cycle; or    12 months of service at the duty station if assigned to a duty station with a 12-month home leave cycle; and      The staff member’s service is expected to continue for at least three months beyond the date of return from the family visit travel.      For staff members assigned to a designated special operations approach (SOA) duty station, the conditions of this section are based on the home leave cycle of the SOA location.      For Mobility and Hardship classification of a duty station, please refer to the ICSC website.       Combination with Other Types of Travel      6. A staff member may be required to undertake family visit travel in conjunction with travel on official business or change of duty station. However, the interests of the staff member and his/her family should be given due regard.      Loss of Entitlement       A staff member loses the entitlement to family visit travel if he/she:    Acquires the status of a permanent resident in the country of the duty station; or    Changes his/her nationality for United Nations purposes to that of the country of the duty station.       Eligible staff members who do not exercise family visit travel do not receive any payment in lieu of the travel expenses, nor are they credited with additional annual leave in lieu of travel time.       Separation from Service       A staff member who is separated from service without completing the required three months’ service following the date of his/her return from family visit travel will not receive payment of repatriation travel expenses for himself/herself. However, the staff member will receive payment of repatriation shipment or relocation grant. In such cases, the family visit will be considered as the repatriation travel, and the staff member should be informed of the change in his/her entitlement in writing.       The local operations manager should inform the OHR Copenhagen HR specialist serving the duty station of the dates of the staff member’s last family visit travel. The family visit travel should also be reflected in the Certificate of Annual Leave Balance form.      However, the OHR Copenhagen HR specialist serving the duty station may authorize such payment if he/she is satisfied that there are compelling reasons for doing so.      Interval between Entitlement-Related Travels       A minimum of three months is normally required between entitlement-related travels (e.g. reverse education grant travel counting from the date of return to the duty station from one travel to the date of departure of the next travel).       However, for those duty stations with an eight-week (or less) frequency for rest and recuperation travel the normal minimum three-month interval for entitlement-related travels (e.g. reverse education grant travel) is reduced to two months.       Destination and Cost       Family visit travel is authorized and will be paid between the duty station and either:    The staff member’s officially recognized home leave place and back to the duty station;    The place of recruitment, if eligible family members are residing there, and back to the duty station; or    The previous duty station, if eligible family members are residing there, and back to the duty station.       If the staff member wishes to visit eligible family members residing at any other place, the travel may be approved, but UNDP will only pay whichever of the two following costs is lower:    Travel from the duty station to the place where the family visit is exercised and back to the duty station; or    Travel from the duty station to the staff member’s officially recognized home leave place and back to the duty station.        Staff Members Assigned to Designated Special Operations Approach Locations       For staff members assigned to designated SOA locations, family visit travel is authorized and will be paid between the SOA location and either:    The staff member’s officially recognized home leave place and back to the SOA location;    The place of recruitment, if eligible family members are residing there, and back to the SOA location;    The previous duty station, if eligible family members are residing there, and back to the SOA location; or    The administrative place of assignment, if eligible family members are residing there, and back to the SOA location.       If the staff member wishes to visit eligible family members residing at any other place, the travel may be approved, but UNDP will only pay whichever of the two following costs is lower:    Travel from the SOA location to the place where the family visit travel is exercised and back to the SOA location; or    Travel from the duty station to the staff member’s officially recognized home leave place and back to the SOA location.       Excursion or Special Fares       Whenever excursion fares or special fares apply, the travel entitlement is limited to the excursion or special fare, provided such fares would allow the traveller an approved stop for rest or official purposes.       An excursion fare or special fare may be changed, if necessary, to a regular fare after the journey has begun, with prior authorization from the office that authorized the travel. UNDP will pay any penalties on special fares resulting from changes for official reasons. A staff member who changes the official itinerary for personal reasons must pay the difference between the new fare and the excursion fare.       Length       20. There is no absolute minimum length of stay. However, as the aim of family visit travel is to enable expatriate staff alone in their duty station to visit their families, the staff member is expected to spend a reasonable length of time at his/her destination when exercising family visit travel.          Reverse Family Visit       Spouse      21. In lieu of exercising his/her family travel entitlement, a staff member may request the travel of his/her spouse to visit him/her at the duty station. This may be authorized, provided the duty station where the staff member is stationed has not been designated non-family. The provisions of family visit outlined in this chapter will generally be applicable when the spouse travels on reverse family visit travel.       Children      22. Under no circumstances may children travel as part of a family visit travel entitlement; eligible children may exercise education grant travel.       Travel Time and Leave Accrual      For travel on an outward and return journey on family visit travel, staff members shall be granted a fixed amount of travel time not chargeable to their annual leave balance, determined on the basis of the most direct flight available as follows:   One day for each journey of less than 10 hours;   Two days for each journey of 10 hours or longer but less than 16 hours; and   Three days for each journey of 16 hours or more.       Additional details on this and other interactions between travel time and annual leave can be found in administrative instruction ST/AI/2013/3.       Except for allowable travel time as outlined above and in the appropriate Administrative Instructions, the number of days spent on family visit is charged to the staff member’s annual leave balance.        ",
    "fellowship": "UNDP Fellowship Policy  The Fellowship Policy establishes and provides guidance on the UNDP fellowship programme and provides information on the administration of UNDP fellows (“Fellows”). This Policy covers both Sponsoring Entity Fellowships (as defined below) and UNDP Corporate Fellowships (as defined below). Unless otherwise specified here, the principles in this policy apply to both types of fellowships.   A “Sponsoring Entity” may be any institution, public or private, including a government, which is committed to core UN values and UN causes, and which may not be involved in commercial or other activities that are incompatible with UNDP’s values, mandate and reputation. Fellowships funded by a Sponsoring Entity are defined as “Sponsoring Entity Fellowships”.   “UNDP Corporate Fellowships” means the placement of Fellows through a fellowship programme/initiative designed, administered and funded by UNDP.   Purpose  The purpose of the fellowship programme is to: Provide students, recent graduates, mid-career professionals from diverse backgrounds, including those working in and affiliated to academic institutions, and other individuals forming part of talent groups, including under-represented groups, with exposure to development issues and first-hand experience of the day-to-day work of UNDP; Provide UNDP with additional skills and expertise to support its activities and mandate; and  For fellowships sponsored by a Sponsoring Entity, provide Sponsoring Entities with insight into UNDP and its work.  Eligibility and Selection of Fellows   In the case of Sponsoring Entity Fellowships, Fellows will be identified through collaboration between UNDP and the Sponsoring Entity. The eligibility criteria for specific fellowship initiatives will be agreed by the Sponsoring Entity and UNDP, taking into account UNDP’s expectations and the opportunities available at UNDP. The final selection of the Fellows will be done by UNDP. UNDP may limit the number of Fellows that may be received from a Sponsoring Entity at any given time.  In the case of UNDP Corporate Fellowships, the selection of the Fellow will be done by UNDP based on the eligibility criteria detailed in the Fellowship Project/Programme Document governing the specific fellowship initiative.  Fellows will be identified from as wide a geographical basis as possible, without distinction as to race, nationality or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, family status or disability.  In order to avoid real or perceived family influence or conflict of interest, UNDP’s policy on Family Relationships applies to the selection of Fellows.  Fellowship Agreement and Fellowship Undertaking Letter   In the case of Sponsoring Entity Fellowships, UNDP and the Sponsoring Entity must sign a fellowship agreement (“Fellowship Agreement”) in the format attached to the procedures. If the Sponsoring Entity is a private sector entity, the Fellowship Agreement formalizes a private sector partnership and thus, the Private Sector Partnerships Policy and Procedures to formalize partnerships with private sector entities apply, including the completion of the due diligence process and the risk management of the partnership.   If the Sponsoring Entity wishes to collaborate with UNDP by providing Fellows for a specific Bureau or Office, the Fellowship Agreement will be signed by the Head of the relevant Bureau or Office. In all other cases, the Fellowship Agreement will be signed by the Director, Office of Human Resources (OHR/BMS) or delegated official.  Both in the case of Sponsoring Entity Fellowships and UNDP Corporate Fellowships, prior to the Fellows taking their assignments with UNDP, each Fellow must sign a fellowship undertaking letter (a “Fellowship Undertaking letter”) in the format attached to the procedures.   Status   Fellows are not considered “staff members” nor “officials” of UNDP, nor are they otherwise employed or contracted by UNDP. Therefore, the United Nations Staff Regulations and Staff Rules do not apply to Fellows. Instead, the status, rights, obligations and duties of Fellows are governed by this policy and the Fellowship Undertaking Letter, and in the case of Sponsoring Entity Fellowships only, they are also governed by the Fellowship Agreement.    For the purpose of the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations of 1946 (the “Convention”), Fellows may, at UNDP’s discretion, be considered “experts on mission” within the meaning of Article VI, Sections 22 and 23 of the Convention when performing functions for UNDP.  Fellows may not be sought or engaged as substitutes for staff members and may not supervise staff members.   Fellows may not represent UNDP in any official capacity nor commit UNDP, financially or otherwise.  Fellows may not apply for, nor be appointed to, any staff position, nor may they apply to (nor be considered for) consultancies or any other type of paid engagement with UNDP during the period of their fellowship.  Location of Fellowships   Fellows may be assigned to UNDP’s headquarters offices or to any UNDP country or regional office in a location that is not designated as a non-family or high-risk duty station.   Administration of Fellowships, Responsibilities and Obligations of Receiving Offices and Supervisors    In the case of Sponsoring Entity Fellowships, the administration of Fellows is decentralized and managed by the receiving country, regional or headquarters’ office, subject to oversight by BMS/OHR. UNDP Corporate Fellowship are designed and administered by BMS/OHR.   The receiving office and the Fellow’s supervisor will create a working environment conducive to the Fellow’s substantive learning and professional development. The receiving Office must:  Prepare terms of reference describing the tasks of the Fellow; Ensure that a Fellow’s assignment is at the appropriate level of complexity and variety; Provide the Fellow with office space, office support, office, security and communications equipment and other resources necessary for the performance of the Fellow’s tasks; Provide guidance and constructive feedback to the Fellow regarding the Fellow’s performance; and Ensure that the Fellow is included in the security arrangements of the duty station, including security plans and briefings.  Responsibilities and Obligations of Fellows   Fellows must:  Observe all applicable regulations, rules, policies, procedures, instructions and other directives, including all security guidance, standards and other safety and security arrangements;  Although Fellows are not “officials” of UNDP, comply with the standards of conduct set forth in the Secretary General’s Bulletin ST/SGB/2002/9 of 18 June 2002, entitled “Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission”; Comply with the standards of conduct set forth in the Secretary-General’s Bulletin ST/SGB/2003/13 of 9 October 2003, concerning “Special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse” and with UNDP’s Policy on “Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority”; Upon completion of the fellowship, provide the receiving office with all materials prepared or collected by them during their fellowship. UNDP shall be entitled to all property rights, including, but not limited to, patents, copyrights and trademarks, with regards to material that bears a direct relation to, or is made as a consequence of, the activities conducted during the fellowships. At the request of UNDP, the Fellows shall assist UNDP in securing such property rights and transferring them to UNDP in compliance with the requirements of the applicable law; Respect the impartiality and independence required of the United Nations, UNDP and the receiving office and not seek nor accept instructions regarding the activities conducted under the fellowship from any Government or from any authority, organization or body external to UNDP;  Refrain from communicating at any time to the media or to any institution, person, Government or any other party external to UNDP any information that has become known to them by reason of their association with the United Nations, UNDP or the receiving office unless otherwise authorized by the receiving office. Fellows may not use any such information without the written authorization of the receiving office, and such information may never be used for personal gain. These obligations also apply after the end of the fellowship with UNDP;  Refrain from any conduct that would adversely reflect on the United Nations, UNDP, or the receiving office and from engaging in any activity which is incompatible with the aims and objectives of the United Nations or UNDP; and  Comply with their personal obligations, local laws and customs, including any taxation requirements.   Liability and Third-party Claims    UNDP will not be responsible for loss or damage to property and personal effects of the Fellow that may occur during the fellowship, except if caused by the gross negligence or willful acts of UNDP.   UNDP will not be responsible for any claims by any parties for loss of or damage to their property, death or personal injury caused by the actions or omissions of the Fellows during their fellowship.  In the case of Sponsoring Entity Fellowships, the Sponsoring Entity must indemnify UNDP and its officials against all claims arising out of acts or omissions of the Fellow as further specified in the Fellowship Agreement. The Sponsoring Entity remains responsible for all costs, liabilities and other obligations related to or arising from the fellowship, as described in this policy and as elaborated in the Fellowship Agreement.  Stipends, Insurance and other Expenses   Fellows are paid a monthly stipend. Stipends are neither a salary, remuneration nor an honorarium.   In the case of Sponsoring Entity Fellowships:   The stipend rates will be stipulated in the Fellowship Agreement. If the Sponsoring Entity so desires, the “UNDESA Stipend Rate for Fellows and Scholars” table, effective as of 1 January of the year in which the fellowship is conducted may be used by the Sponsoring Entity as a reference to set the stipend rate;   The payment of stipends and other costs related to the fellowship are the responsibility of the Sponsoring Entity. In no case will UNDP pay the stipend directly to the Fellows nor will it be responsible for the payment of any costs related to the fellowship (other than costs incurred by Fellows while undertaking official travel at the request of UNDP);  The Sponsoring Entity must secure, or ensure that the Fellows secure, adequate medical insurance coverage for the duration of the fellowship. If the Sponsoring Entity so requests, UNDP may help the Sponsoring Entity identify a suitable medical insurance provider. UNDP will bear no responsibility for medical insurance nor for any other costs arising from accidents and illness incurred during a fellowship assignment, which will be the responsibility of the Fellow unless such costs arise from the gross negligence or willful acts of UNDP; and   The medical coverage secured by the Fellow or the Sponsoring Entity as per paragraph 25 (c) above, must be proper for the duty station in which the Fellow will be based, and proof of coverage must be submitted by the Sponsoring Entity to UNDP before the start of the fellowship assignment. For Fellows who are neither nationals nor residents of the duty station to which they are assigned, the medical coverage scheme must include adequate coverage in the event of an injury or illness during the fellowship which: Requires transportation to the home country or country of residence for further treatment;  Results in death and requires preparation and repatriation of the remains to the home country, or country of residence.   In the case of UNDP Corporate Fellowships:  The stipend will be paid by UNDP in accordance with the rates set in the “UNDESA Stipend Rate for Fellows and Scholars” table, effective as of 1 January of the year in which the fellowship is conducted; and   UNDP will be responsible for obtaining proper medical coverage for the Fellow.   Fellows must provide a medical certificate of good health prior to starting the fellowship.   Travel  In the case of Sponsoring Entity Fellowships, arrangements for travel and obtaining visas and passports, and their costs are the responsibility of the Sponsoring Entity.   In the case of UNDP Corporate Fellowships, arrangements for travel and for obtaining visas and passports, and their costs are the responsibility of UNDP.   Both in the case of UNDP Corporate Fellowships and Sponsoring Entity Fellowships, the costs incurred by Fellows while undertaking official travel at the request of UNDP will be reimbursed by UNDP on the same basis as costs reimbursed to staff members, including payment of daily subsistence allowance, if applicable.   Duration and Conditions of the Fellowships    Fellowships must not exceed twelve (12) months.  In the case of Sponsoring Entity Fellowships, the exact length of the fellowship will be agreed by UNDP and the Sponsoring Entity, within the limitation set forth in Paragraph 31.    The fellowship assignment may not be foreshortened for the purposes of allowing a Fellow to apply for a staff position, a consultancy or any other type of paid engagement with UNDP.  Fellowship assignments are available on a part-time and full-time basis. The fellowship may be performed using flexible working arrangements if:  The receiving office agrees in writing to such arrangements; and  The Fellow agrees to work the equivalent of a minimum of at least two (2) months on a full-time basis during the whole period of the fellowship.  In the case of Sponsoring Entity Fellowships, leave entitlements will be granted in accordance with what is stipulated in the Fellowship Agreement, subject to a minimum of one and a half (1.5) days of leave per month.  In the case of UNDP Corporate Fellowships, Fellows will accrue annual leave at the rate of one and a half (1 ½ ) days per month.   Any accrued leave days not used by the end of the fellowship will be forfeited.   Leave plans must be submitted by the Fellows to and for approval by their UNDP supervisor.   Fellows will be granted sick leave at the rate of two (2) working days per month. A medical certificate must support absences of more than seven (7) consecutive days.  The Fellow will be entitled to time off for official UN holidays observed by the receiving office.   Termination   A fellowship assignment may be terminated by either UNDP, the Fellow or, in the case of a Sponsoring Entity Fellowships, by the Sponsoring Entity for any reason, upon giving two (2) weeks’ notice, except that UNDP will be entitled to terminate a fellowship assignment without notice if the Fellow breaches any of the responsibilities or obligations set forth in the section on “Responsibilities and Obligations” of this Policy as contained in the Fellowship Undertaking Letter and, in the case of a Sponsoring Entity Fellowship, the Fellowship Agreement.   Recording, Evaluation and Certification    Once the Fellowship Undertaking Letter is signed, the personal information of the Fellow will be entered into ATLAS.  At the end of the fellowship, the Fellow’s supervisor will prepare a written evaluation of the Fellow’s performance and organize a meeting with the Fellow to provide feedback.  In the case of Sponsoring Entity Fellowships, the receiving office will also provide to the Sponsoring Entity other evaluations and reports of the assignment and/or conduct of the Fellow, subject to any confidentiality requirements of UNDP, as agreed in the Fellowship Agreement.   Upon completion of the fellowship, the Fellow may receive a certificate of completion from UNDP/the receiving office upon request.  Subsequent Employment    There is no expectation of employment with UNDP following a fellowship.",
    "flexible-working-arrangements": "Flexible Working Arrangements    1.  The purpose of this policy is to provide options for flexible working arrangements and alternative ways that best achieve overall programme objectives and optimal performance, while balancing the needs of staff members with the demands of work. This policy supersedes all other versions of policies and procedures on working arrangements.    Guiding Principles    A facility, not an entitlement   \t  2.\tFlexible working arrangements must be applied consistently and equitably.  However, it is understood that flexible working arrangements may be more suitable to some jobs or functions than to others, and as such the decision on how best to implement flexible working arrangements remains at the discretion of the manager who is responsible for the results of the organizational unit. Therefore, the granting or continuation of an already approved flexible working arrangement is not an entitlement.  A flexible working arrangement may be deferred or cancelled at any time, if the manager considers that the urgent needs and priorities of work require staff members to return to a normal schedule of reporting to the office. The withdrawal or decline of a request for flexible working is not subject to UNDP’s grievance/appeals procedures.   Cost neutrality   \t  3.\tThe introduction and operation of flexible working arrangements do not normally represent additional costs for the Organization unless exceptionally approved by the Head of Office/Bureau.    Performance and accountability    4.\tThe organizational unit is accountable for maintaining its overall productivity levels, a mutual accountability exists under flexible working arrangements. Therefore, staff members must ensure that their level of productivity is sustained by choosing to work flexibly. The work plan of a unit and an individual must reflect the flexible working arrangements, including arrangements for an individual who will serve as a backup for a specific function. In addition, supervisors must take into account the backstopping element and reflect it in the performance assessment of the staff members concerned. Managers and staff members are expected to define clear deliverables prior to the start of a flexible working arrangement and keep lines of communication open throughout its duration, even on a telecommuting arrangement (See paragraph 64 and subsequent paragraphs).    \tDiscussions with appropriate parties \t    5.\tThe implementation of flexible working arrangements should always take place following detailed discussions on the work implications for all involved; this could mean intra-office discussions and, in some instances, also inter-office discussions. Office supervisors have a responsibility for consulting all parties concerned, especially other team members who work with the individual who is requesting flexible working arrangements.  The arrangements are subject to review on an on-going basis.     Options    6.  UNDP offers the following flexible working arrangements:  Flexitime  Compressed working schedules  Part-time employment  Telecommuting.    Flexitime    Definition    7.   Flexitime is defined as flexible working hours at the beginning and/or end of the day, that are core hours established by respective offices during which all staff members must be present at work.    Eligibility    8.\tThe option for flexitime work is open to all categories of staff members. However, the needs of the Organization must come first, and flexitime is an option, not a right. In very small offices, flexitime may not be feasible; however, such decisions are at the discretion of each individual office.    Length of work day    9.   All staff members must work a set number of hours per day, though this policy permits a flexible time schedule within the limits defined herein. All staff members, including those who opt to work under a flexitime arrangement, except those working on a part-time basis, must take a 30-minute lunch break according to parameters defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO).    Core time    10. Core time refers to the hours of the day when staff members must be at work. For example, the core hours established for UNDP headquarters in New York are 10:00am to 4:00pm. They are intended to guide managers in the organization of activities, such as meetings where input from all staff members is required. Outside core hours, staff members may complete functions not requiring interaction with other staff members; however, they are expected to work the number of hours per day established by respective offices, under the common workweek.    Starting and ending times    Starting and ending times can be varied to meet personal needs of staff members. However, this is not an entitlement but an agreement between managers and staff members, with an understanding of the impact on colleagues in the section/unit.    Flexitime example for New York: The official core hours are from 10:00am to 4:00pm daily. Examples of flexible hours could be: from 8:00am to 4:00pm (4:30pm during October, November and December) daily; or from 10:00am to 6:00pm (6:30pm during October, November and December) daily, established for a fixed and renewable period of time.    Resumption of normal working hours    The supervisor or staff member may request that flexitime arrangements cease if the supervisor considers that the needs of the Organization necessitate a return to normal working hours, or the needs of the staff member change.     In cases where the supervisor requests a return to normal hours, the staff member will be given a reasonable time (maximum one month) to make arrangements to facilitate a return to regular, full-time working hours.    Compressed working schedules    Definition    15. Compressed working schedules permit staff members to increase the number of hours worked per day to:   gain free time on other days; or   have a day off.     This can be accomplished by adding a small amount of work time to each working day, enabling the accumulation of enough hours to take every alternate Friday off, for example. Options to consider are outlined below:    The ‘10 in 9’ option    Under this option, a staff member works a two-week schedule of 10 days in nine days.    The Head of office – after consulting with the staff association – determines which day of the week will be the potential free day every other week. In duty stations where Friday is part of the weekend, the alternative day off would fall on the last day of the working week, or Country Offices might decide that the first working day of the week would serve as the most suitable day for supporting this programme.    Determining the time that must be added to each working day is simple. At headquarters, for example, staff members would have to work an additional 50 minutes per day.     While all categories of staff members are eligible to participate, supervisors should ensure staggered use of the alternate Friday off/day off. Coverage at all times is an essential part of smoothly integrating flexible working arrangements into the work of a section/unit. Discussions need to take into account the distribution of work among staff members.    Occasions may arise where the immediate demands of work prevent a staff member from enjoying a specific alternate day off. When this happens, there is no deferral of the day off to another day or the accrual of free days to be taken in the future.    A lunch break should be used for its intended purpose. Therefore, staff members are not permitted to forfeit the lunch break in lieu of additional working hours.    Managerial discipline is required to avoid scheduling meetings on staff members’ scheduled days off.    A compressed working schedule must be modelled on the following examples for a specified period and be agreed by the immediate supervisor:    The ‘5 in 4 1/2’ option    Under this option, the staff member is allowed to work the total number of working hours of five days in four-and-a-half. Example: In an office where the total workweek comprises 35 working hours, the staff member works eight hours from Monday to Thursday and three hours on Friday.    The ‘3 and 2’ option    25. Under this option, the staff member may leave up to three hours earlier two days per week. The six hours are compensated by adding two hours to the remaining three days of the week.    The ‘2 and 2’ option    26. Under this option, the staff member may leave up to two hours earlier two days per week. The four hours are compensated by adding one hour and 20 minutes to the remaining three days of the week; or one hour-and-a-half to two of the remaining three days and one hour to the third day.    The ‘1 and 3’ option    27.\tUnder this option, the staff member may leave up to one hour earlier three days per week. The three hours are compensated by adding one hour and a half to the remaining two days of the week.    The ‘1 1⁄2 and 3’ option    28.\tUnder this option, the staff member may leave up to one and a half hours earlier three days per week. The four and a half hours are compensated by adding two-and-a-quarter hours to the remaining two days of the week.    Part-time employment    Definition    29.\tPart-time employment allows existing staff members to adjust their work schedule for a limited period of time, to less than 100 percent full-time work. Work can only be reduced to 50 percent to 80 percent of the established work time, as agreed between staff members and their supervisors.    Eligibility    Part-time employment is available to all categories of existing staff members for a limited period, while occupying and serving in a specific post. Part-time employment may be granted for child-care responsibilities, illness in the family, pursuit of outside studies relevant to UNDP work, and other such situations.     Bearing in mind that part-time work can only be considered in the context of the post’s description/duties, the Organization must be satisfied that:  Part-time work is justifiable;  There is a structure in place for the staff member to carry out the agreed responsibilities of the post on a part-time basis; and   The work of the Organization will not suffer as a result of this part-time arrangement.    If at any time during the part-time arrangement the supervisor considers that the work is adversely affected as a result of the arrangement, the supervisor will review the situation with the Head of office and will ask the staff member concerned to change to full-time employment, normally within one month.    Establishment of part-time employment depends on agreement between the staff member and supervisor and approval by the Head of office concerning the structure of work and the delivery of sufficient productivity to support the office work programme; each request to enter into part-time employment arrangements must be carefully reviewed.    Contractual Status    When a staff member avails of the part-time employment arrangement, offices will be allowed to monetize the remainder of the full-time position to fund additional capacity, as needed.   A change to part-time employment shall not affect the staff member’s contractual status. Part-time staff members benefit from the same privileges and immunities and are subject to the same obligations and restrictions relating to outside activities under the relevant staff rules as full-time staff members.   Official Holidays and Overtime    Staff members on part-time employment will be granted official holidays only when such holidays fall on a regular working day in their regular schedule. Part-time staff members may not change their regular schedule to take advantage of an official holiday.    General Service part-time staff members who are required to work in excess of their regular schedule shall be remunerated at the straight time rate for additional hours worked up to the normal scheduled workday of full-time staff members. Thereafter, and for work required on the sixth or seventh day of the scheduled workweek or on an official holiday, they shall be compensated according to the conditions governing compensation for overtime work.    Salary and Allowances    Under a part-time work schedule, compensation is adjusted to the agreed proportion of work at the staff member’s grade level and step, and forms the basis for determining prorated salary and applicable allowances, except for health, dental and life insurance. BES/GSSC helps assess how entry into a part-time work schedule would affect the compensation package.    Within-grade salary increments accrue under the same conditions and with the same periodicity as for full-time staff members.    Under a part-time work schedule, a staff member who is temporarily assigned to a higher-level function is only eligible for Special Post Allowance if the staff member reverts back to a full-time working schedule.    Dependent child allowance    In cases where a part-time staff member or the staff member’s spouse receives a direct governmental grant in respect of dependent children, the total amount of the grant shall be deducted from the prorated amount of the dependency allowance payable to the staff member. If the government grant exceeds the amount of the prorated dependency allowance, this will not preclude the recognition of the children as dependants of the staff member for other purposes such as coverage by medical insurance.    The earnings limit for the dependent spouse allowance shall not be prorated.    Mobility and hardship allowance    The qualifying period of service shall be prorated for staff members in part-time employment. For example, 15 months of service at 80 percent will count as one year.    Education grant or special education grant    Payment to eligible part-time staff members shall be under the same terms and conditions as for full-time staff members in similar circumstances but prorated based on the agreed proportion of work.  Rental subsidy   Part-time staff members shall be entitled to rental subsidy under the same terms and conditions as full-time staff members, except that they will receive a prorated portion based on the agreed proportion of work.   Annual leave    The 2 1⁄2 days per month of annual leave provided to full-time staff members will be adjusted for part-time employment based on the agreed proportion of work. For example, for staff members on an 80 percent part-time basis, they will be entitled to two full days of annual leave per month (80 percent of 2 1⁄2 = 2). A maximum of 48 full days of annual leave may be carried forward from 31 March of each year (80 percent of 60 days = 48);    Staff members seeking 80 percent part-time employment should first bring their accrued annual leave balance to 48 days or less before changing to part-time employment, so as not to lose any accrued annual leave beyond the 48-day maximum entitlement. Following a change to part-time employment, a staff member cannot use accrued annual leave to remain on full pay.    Sick leave    The same provisions governing sick leave in respect of full-time staff members apply to part-time staff members. During sick leave, part-time staff members will receive their respective prorated salary and allowances. For example, staff members on 80 percent part-time employment are entitled to five and a half days of uncertified sick leave per calendar year — representing 80 percent of the normal seven-day entitlement for full-time staff members.    Maternity leave    The maternity leave benefits granted to full-time staff members are also afforded to part-time staff members. During maternity leave, part-time staff members will receive their respective prorated salary and allowances.  As a general rule, requests for extended leave (either annual or unpaid) up to 6 months and flexible working hours following maternity leave should be granted.  In case there is a compelling reason that prevents the supervisor from granting the request, a written justification must be endorsed by the Head of Office and the respective Bureau.  Paternity Leave  The paternity leave benefits granted to full-time staff members are also afforded to part-time staff members. During paternity leave, part-time staff members will receive their respective prorated salary and allowances.  As a general rule, requests for extended leave (either annual or unpaid) and flexible working arrangements following paternity leave should be granted.  In case there is a compelling reason that prevents the supervisor from granting the request, a written justification must be endorsed by the Head of Office and the respective Bureau.    Adoption and Surrogacy Leave   The adoption and surrogacy leave benefits granted to full-time staff members are also afforded to part-time staff members. During adoption or surrogacy leave, part-time staff members will receive their respective prorated salary and allowances.  As a general rule, requests for extended leave (either annual or unpaid) and flexible working arrangements following adoption or surrogacy leave should be granted.  In case there is a compelling reason that prevents the supervisor from granting the request, a written justification must be endorsed by the Head of the Office and the respective Bureau.   Education grant travel   Part-time staff members eligible for education grant travel for their children shall be granted such travel under the same conditions as full-time staff members, except that they shall receive a prorated portion of the lump sum based on the agreed proportion of work, or they shall be requested to contribute the remaining portion of the actual cost of the ticket which would be payable to full-time staff members for each travel actually undertaken. Travel documents raised (e.g. travel authorization) should reflect the relevant arrangement.   At the time of changing from full-time to part-time employment, the rate of reimbursement for the first education grant travel following the change shall be established on the basis of the longest period of time the staff member has been employed full-time or part-time during the relevant school year.  For example, if the school year has a duration of 10 months and within this period the staff member has worked full-time for five and a half months, the staff member will be entitled to the full costs of the travel expenses.  Home leave and family visit travel    Part-time staff entitled to home leave and/or family visit travel shall be granted such travel and related entitlements under the same terms and conditions and with the same periodicity as full-time staff, except that they shall receive a prorated portion of the lump sum based on the agreed proportion of work, or they shall be requested to contribute the remaining portion of the actual cost of the ticket which would be payable to full-time staff for each travel actually undertaken. Travel documents raised (e.g. travel authorization) should reflect the relevant arrangement.    At the time of changing from full-time to part-time employment, the rate of reimbursement for the first home leave/family visit travel following the change shall be established on the basis of the longest period of time the staff member has been employed full-time or part-time during the period between the staff member’s return from their last home leave and the departure date of the staff member’s next home leave.    Medical insurance    Part-time staff members shall be eligible for full medical insurance under the same terms and conditions specified as full-time staff members, except that they will be required to meet the difference in cost for full coverage under their selected medical plan and the proportion covered by the Organization. The amount of the subsidy paid by the Organization will be prorated based on the agreed proportion of work, and the staff member must pay the rest of the premium themselves.    Pension fund participation    Part-time staff members are entitled to participation in the UNJSPF in accordance with supplementary Article A of the Regulations of the Fund. A change to part-time employment will not interrupt a staff member’s participation. The entitlement to and the amount of benefits resulting from part-time employment shall be reduced in the ratio which part-time employment bears to full-time employment. For example, the ratio for someone after one year of work at 80 percent part-time will count as nine months and 18 days of contributory service. The pensionable remuneration used for the calculation of benefits is the pensionable remuneration that would have been applicable for full-time employment.    Part-time pension participants who are on special leave without pay shall be entitled to count such leave without pay as contributory service in the UNJSPF, provided full contributions are received by the Pension Fund. The total amount of these contributions would be the same as that which would have been payable by the participant and the Organization if the participant had continued in part-time employment during that period. In accordance with Article 25(b)(I) of the Regulations of the Fund, if the staff member wishes the time on SLWOP to count as contributory service in the Pension Fund, the staff member must pay these contributions in full.    Seniority in grade    For the purpose of seniority in grade, the qualifying period of service shall be prorated in the case of staff members in part-time employment. For example, 15 months of service at 80 percent will count as one year.    Application for a higher-level post    If part-time staff members wish to apply for a vacancy at a higher grade, they must be advised that they have to revert to full-time employment to be considered eligible. If selected for a higher-level post, the staff member will have to submit a new request to continue part-time employment following the staff member’s placement.     Appendix D entitlements     The compensation benefits payable under Appendix D  of the UN Staff Rules in the event of death, injury or illness shall be prorated based on the agreed proportion of work of the amounts determined in accordance with Articles 10.2 and 11.1(c), respectively, except that in the event of death the benefits shall take previous full-time service into account on a prorated basis. The additional lump-sum payments made in the case of injury or illness resulting in permanent disfigurement or permanent loss of a member or function shall be the full amounts indicated in Article 11.3(c) and the full amounts determined in accordance with Article 11.3(d).     Separation from service travel     Eligible part-time staff members separating from the Organization are entitled to return travel under the same conditions as full-time staff members, provided the appropriate service requirements have been satisfied. Such staff members shall be entitled to the same unaccompanied shipment and removal entitlements as full-time staff members, provided their combined period of full-time service is equivalent to the period of service required for full-time staff members to receive such entitlements. A period of part-time service will be counted on a prorated basis for these purposes at the agreed proportion of the work.     Termination indemnity     Part-time staff members shall be paid termination indemnity in accordance with the provisions of Annex III to the UN Staff Regulations under the same terms and conditions of full-time staff members, except that periods of service in part-time employment shall be prorated accordingly. For example, for staff members working at 80 percent part-time, 15 months of service shall be counted as one year of service.   Repatriation grant    Repatriation grant shall be paid to part-time staff members under the same terms and conditions as for full-time staff members in accordance with Annex IV of the Staff Rules, except that periods of service in part-time employment shall be prorated accordingly. For example, for staff members working at 80 percent part-time, 15 months of part-time service shall be counted as one year of service.     Commutation of accrued annual leave     For part-time staff members separating from the Organization, annual leave may be paid up to the maximum number allowed based on their part-time employment — i.e. whether 50 percent or 80 percent of the total 60 days granted to full-time staff members.    Death benefit     For the purpose of calculating a death benefit, the period of service in part-time employment shall be counted at the prorated proportional rate as the period in full-time employment.    Telecommuting    Definition    Telecommuting allows staff members to perform their regular work schedule in an alternate location away from the office.    Options    To effectively implement a telecommuting arrangement, both the staff member and the staff member’s office must be able to support the telecommunication/automation platform that makes the separation from the workplace insignificant.    UNDP currently offers two types of telecommuting that now serve as the models for broader application: an alternate dedicated worksite, for full-time work performed outside the office; or scheduled periodic work away from the office, for work temporarily performed outside the office.    Alternate dedicated worksite    Full-time telecommuting is currently considered most appropriate for highly specialized work where the service is delivered primarily through automated systems. To consider the creation of a full-time telecommuting arrangement, staff members and their supervisors must first address together several issues:   Does the nature of the work allow it to be easily done away from the office?   Can an individual work plan be crafted which specifies measurable outputs to be achieved within fixed time-frames?   Can the work of the staff member be easily integrated with the work of colleagues in the office?   Are the costs of telecommuting sustainable for the staff member and the office?   Telecommuting compact (full time)     UNDP has established a structure for assessing the conditions that must be met for a staff member and the staff member’s supervisor to establish a formal telecommuting arrangement. The Telecommuting Agreement contains a structured compact that addresses each issue where the terms of the telecommuting arrangement are specified. At the end of the compact both staff member and supervisor establish the term of the arrangement. It is understood by both parties that either party may terminate the arrangement at the end of the agreed term with a return to the traditional working environment consistent with the staff member’s employment contract.    Telecommuting can take place from a site as close as the normal commuting distance from the office or as far as from another country on another continent. Depending on this distance, the creation of a telecommuting arrangement may require an adjustment in the staff member’s conditions of service. This may require a change of duty station for the purpose of entitlements for which the HR focal point at the duty station must inform the HR Team Lead in BES/GSSC.  If the full-time telecommuting arrangement commences before completion of one year in the duty station of assignment, the payments related to relocation and settling-in shall normally be prorated and recovered or adjusted accordingly.  Entering into a full-time telecommuting arrangement does not change the contractual status under which a staff member is employed. Where there is no change in duty station required to establish the alternate dedicated worksite, conclusion of the telecommuting compact would be sufficient to establish the arrangement. For nationally recruited staff members, telecommuting arrangements are currently restricted to alternate dedicated worksites within the country or within commuting distance.    Equipment needs    The responsibility to comprehend and apply computer-based approaches to everyday work rests primarily with the individual. While the Organization facilitates the introduction of automation technologies to the workplace, formal organized training will not be a regular feature for most new computer applications. Therefore, the establishment of a telecommuting work arrangement pre-supposes the capacity of the staff member, supervisor and colleagues to work effectively in the virtual environment.    The  Organization may mandate certain telecommunication/computer specifications necessary to support a telecommuting workplace away from the office. These specifications cover the equipment, software and telecommunication interface which are minimally necessary. The capability to set up and maintain this platform must rest with the staff member. The cost of the computer equipment may be fully or partially supported by the Organization, depending on which option for telecommuting governs the working arrangement.    Equipment costs    Where telecommuting has been arranged as a full-time form of employment, the cost of computer equipment, up to the cost of equipment which would be normally provided by the Organization for a standard employment arrangement, can be applied to support telecommuting. The staff member should meet additional costs for peripheral equipment such as printers, scanners, cameras and modems. Equipment purchased by UNDP to support a telecommuting arrangement must be entered into the equipment inventory of the office concerned and returned to the Organization at the conclusion of the telecommuting arrangement. The computer must be password protected and dedicated to the work of UNDP.    Telecommunication costs related to the maintenance of a telecommuting arrangement incurred by the staff member must be borne by the staff member. Much like the transportation costs incurred by staff members who commute to work under the standard working arrangements, the telecommuting costs incurred should be seen as intrinsic costs of this type of employment. With respect to the cost for occasional travel by a telecommuting staff member to the office for consultations and work planning, it should be possible for offices to demonstrate savings in other areas (e.g. mission travel), which may be used to offset these costs. Offices should be aware that a telecommuting staff member should be present in the office for at least one week per year to review the work arrangement and arrange for continuation or re-integration into the office.    Scheduled periodic work away from the office    The other form of telecommuting is a hybrid form of employment that combines work within the standard office with periodic work from an alternate site. Under informal arrangements, staff members are permitted to work occasionally from home and are listed for attendance purposes as if present at work.  For the occasional need to work from home to support a particular assignment or for a very short unforeseen personal need, UNDP will leave the current informal approaches in place. These approaches depend on close communication between the staff member and supervisor to ensure that the occasional work from home meets the staff member’s commitments to the Organization.    Telecommuting compact (part time)    Under the arrangements for scheduled periodic work away from the office, a staff member may work from an alternative site up to two days per week. This work must be supported by a telecommunications/automation platform that allows the staff member to connect fully to the office. A telecommuting compact must also be established between the staff member and the supervisor for telecommuting as provided for in the Telecommuting Agreement, which includes a sample agreement that establishes the schedule for work away from the office. This schedule should provide for clearly established times when the staff member will be telecommuting.    With a hybrid working arrangement, the Organization will be required to maintain working facilities in the office for the staff member. While other staff members, temporary assistance or consultants may use these facilities during the scheduled periods of telecommuting, it is unlikely that the Organization will realize any significant resource savings through this telecommuting arrangement which can be applied to assist in meeting the costs of creating a viable work platform at the alternate site. Therefore, under this arrangement, the cost for the computer equipment and related telecommunication connections are normally borne entirely by the staff member, but exceptions may be made by the Head of the Office/Bureau. Similarly, telecommunication costs incurred by the staff member in support of the telecommuting arrangements also must be met by the staff member.    Duration    As with full-time telecommuting, the arrangements for scheduled periodic work away from the office should be established for a maximum of one year. These arrangements will be subject to review and the agreement of both the staff member and the supervisor for extension. Similar to the approach for introducing flexible work arrangements, the introduction of telecommuting should take into account the impact on the work of colleagues and co-workers in the section/unit/working team. For telecommuting to work effectively, means of communication not only between the staff member and supervisor but also with peers must be established.    Considerations pertaining to costs and liabilities    UNDP will not be liable for damages to the staff member’s personal property while the staff member is performing official duties or while using UNDP equipment. If the staff member’s home has been designated as the place for telecommuting, the staff member should review their home insurance policies, as the use of the home as an office may not be covered by existing contracts.    Staff members are responsible for providing a reasonably safe and secure working environment to carry out their responsibilities.     ",
    "group-life-insurance-plan-glip": " Group Life Insurance Plan (GLIP)  A group life insurance plan (“plan” or “GLIP”) is offered to staff of the United Nations Secretariat, funds, and programmes, providing term insurance coverage against death and disability. The underwriter of the plan is The Hartford (“insurance company”) and is administered by the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS) at UNHQ. The policyholder is the UN. This insurance plan is a group policy which means that a single contract covers the entire group of plan participants with the UN being the policy holder of this contract.  Except for Junior Professional Officers (JPOs – donor governments fully subsidize the contributions of participating JPOs), this plan is an optional benefit and is financed solely from the contributions of participating staff without any subsidy from the Organization. The plan provides term insurance coverage only and has no cash value at the time of withdrawal.  The terms of the GLIP are subject to change and staff should refer to the HLIS site for the most up to date information. Should the contents of this policy and the information on the HLIS site differ, the information provided on the HLIS site will prevail.  Eligibility   The Group Life Insurance Plan (GLIP) is available to all internationally and locally recruited staff members worldwide governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules who have an appointment of six months or longer and who have been medically cleared upon appointment.   Except for JPOs, participation in the plan is voluntary and staff may withdraw at any time. For JPOs, participation in the plan is compulsory.   Participation in the plan is open and automatic for those who apply within 60 days of signing the qualifying letter of appointment.   Those who apply after 60 days are required, at the time of application, to provide the evidence of insurability satisfactory “Evidence of Insurability” (EOI) form to UN HLIS (through HR Unit – see section 27 below) for review.  UN HLIS will forward the form directly to insurance company, which reserves the right to reject the application or require the applicant to undergo a medical examination at the applicant’s expense. In such cases, coverage will begin only after the insurance company  gives its written consent.      Coverage Insurance coverage level   The amount of life insurance coverage that can be purchased is as follows:   Normally based on three times the participant’s pensionable remuneration, subject to a maximum amount of US$300,000 The current premium rate of $0.28 per $1,000 of coverage is equivalent to .084 per cent of pensionable remuneration.   For those enrolling at age 65, coverage is limited to US$20,000  The maximum coverage for participants who continue in service after the month in which they reach age 65 is reduced.  The level of coverage, and the corresponding premium, for staff members enrolling at 65 years or older is limited to a fixed sum. Beneficiary Eligibility   There are no restrictions as to persons or entities who may be designated as life insurance beneficiaries. Familial relationship does not confer automatic beneficiary status. UN HLIS abides by the most recent Designation of Beneficiary form on record.  Life Insurance benefits   The life insurance coverage consists of a principal sum payable, in the event of death from any cause to the designated beneficiary(ies) and equivalent to the full amount for which the participant was insured at the time of death.  Accidental death and dismemberment benefits  The accidental death coverage consists of an additional sum payable, in the event of accidental loss of life, to the designated beneficiary(ies) and equivalent to the full amount for which the participant was insured at the time of death.  The accidental dismemberment coverage consists of:  The full amount for which the participant was insured will be paid for accidental loss of:   Life Both hands (by severance through or above the wrist joint) Both feet (by severance through or above the wrist and ankle joint)  One hand and one foot (by severance through or above the wrist or ankle joint) One hand and the sight of one eye One foot and the sight of one eye or  The sight of both eyes; or   Half the amount for which the participant was insured will be paid for the accidental loss of:  One hand One foot or  The sight of one eye  Benefits are payable under the accidental death and dismemberment coverage only if the loss:   Results directly and solely from an injury caused by an accident that is not excluded in the limitations of the paragraph immediately below and   Occurs within 90 days of the accident that causes the injury to the participant while insured  Benefits will also be payable if the loss is:  Caused by a pus-forming infection resulting directly and solely from an injury that is covered under the plan or  Caused by a surgical operation that is   Needed solely because of an injury that is covered under the plan and  Performed within 90 days after the injury occurs Accidental death and dismemberment exclusions  Under the accidental death and dismemberment plan, coverage will not apply for the following conditions:  Bodily or mental infirmity Disease, ptomaine or bacterial infections, of any kind Medical or surgical treatment Suicide or attempted suicide (sane or insane) Intentionally self-inflicted injury War or any act of war (declared or undeclared)  The insurance company has consistently interpreted the war exclusion as applying to actions by a sovereign state or government against another.  Terrorism is characterized as premeditated violence for a political purpose by a person or group other than a government or state.  The insurance company, therefore, does NOT exclude terrorist acts from coverage. Accelerated Death Benefit   Effective 1 October 2002, a new benefit called the Accelerated Death Benefit (ADB) is added to the GLIP.  In essence, this optional benefit provides for the payment, to the participant, of a portion of the participant’s life insurance after the participant has been diagnosed as terminally ill, leaving the balance of the life insurance for the benefit of designated beneficiaries after the death of the insured.  Under this arrangement, the cost of the benefit acceleration is recovered by discounting the ADB payment to the insured applicant.  To be considered terminally ill, the applicant must:  Be diagnosed as suffering from an incurable, progressive, and medically   recognized disease or condition  To a reasonable medical probability and on the basis of generally accepted medical protocols, have a life expectancy of no more than 12 months beyond the date of the application for an ADB  The ADB benefit:  Is available to all group life insurance participants (active staff, retirees and those separated for medical reasons)  May be requested at any time;  Is not available, if by assignment or otherwise, someone other than the insured is the owner of the life insurance coverage  May only be requested once under this plan.  The minimum amount that may be requested is US$5,000.  Applicants for an ADB should contact the UN HLIS in the first instance.  They will then be provided with a package comprising an application form, a request-for-medical-documentation letter, authorizations for the release of medical information, and an ADB disclosure statement.  In considering a request for an ADB, the insurance company may require the participant to submit, at the insurance company expense, to an independent medical examination initiated by a physician chosen by the insurance company.  Review of a request for an ADB will be suspended until the examination has been completed and the results submitted to the insurance company.  When a participant elects the ADB option, the arrangement will work as follows.  First, a gross ADB payment is determined.  This amount will be based on a benefit of 50 percent of the amount of life insurance in force on the election date, taking into account any age reduction due to occur during the terminal illness qualifying period.  The appropriate discount will then be deducted from the gross ADB payment to arrive at the net amount actually payable to the insured.  Discounts will reflect the interest rate structure described in the paragraph below.  The remaining amount of life insurance carried in force, after the ADB payment is made, will be the original amount less the gross (before interest discount) ADB payment.  The interest rate used to calculate discounts will be the current yield on the 90-day United States Treasury bill on the date the ADB payment is issued.  The period used to calculate this charge will begin on the date the ADB is paid and will always be equal to the 12 months’ terminal illness qualifying period, regardless of the actual or expected date of death.  Upon approval by the insurance company, the amount of the ADB will be paid in a lump sum.  To the extent allowed by law:  An ADB payment is exempt from any legal or equitable process for the debts of the insured  There can be no requirement to request an ADB in order to satisfy claims of creditors  The insurance company cannot furnish legal or tax advice to the applicant or to the Organization.  Legal counsel and/or a tax adviser should be consulted before a request for an ADB is made. Enrolment and premiums  Application for insurance  Within the first 60 days of eligibility, JPOs and staff members who wish to participate in the GLIP should complete an application form:   For international staff stationed outside New York, and international and local staff stationed in New York, the application is submitted through the self-service portal and the process is supported by the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the organizational unit, for forwarding to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section/UN HLIS (see Claims section)   For local staff stationed outside New York, the completed application form (Link:  Life Insurance Application Form) is submitted to the Human Resources/Operations Manager at the duty station concerned. The forms are kept locally and do not need to be forwarded to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS).  After the first 60 days of eligibility, staff members who wish to participate in the GLIP, enrolment becomes conditional which means that the staff member should complete the following documentation:   An application form (as per above) The Hartford Life Insurance PHA/Evidence of Insurability (EOI) Form  The respective focal point submits the required forms to UN HLIS for a first review after which UN HLIS will forward the form directly to The Hartford which will evaluate eligibility for life insurance enrolment based on the individual profile and might require the applicant to undergo additional medical examinations at the applicant’s own expense. Effective date  Staff members who apply within the first 60 days of eligibility will be covered from the effective date of the letter of appointment.    Staff members who apply after the first 60 days of eligibility and who are required to file evidence of insurability will, if accepted, be covered from the date on which The Hartford  gives its written consent.  Premium  Before 1 October 2002, life insurance levels were set out in a schedule that related coverage amounts to ranges of pensionable remuneration, denominated in US dollars.  The coverage amount corresponded to 2.5 times the pensionable remuneration figure at the top of each bracket.    As of 1 October 2002, a staff member’s life insurance entitlement is directly linked to participant’s pensionable remuneration and will be defined in terms of the related currency.  Under the new system, whenever pensionable remuneration increases, the life insurance amount will increase proportionately also, without regard to any fixed schedule of pensionable remuneration brackets.  As a result, it is now possible to state the required premium contribution as a percentage of pensionable remuneration.        Rate   The current premium rate is US$0.28 per US$1,000 of coverage, which is equivalent to 0.084 percent of pensionable remuneration. Thus, if the level of pensionable remuneration of a participant is US$35,789, the corresponding level of life insurance coverage is three times that figure, i.e., US$107,367.  The corresponding monthly premium payment based on 0.084 percent of pensionable remuneration would be US$30.063.  In the case of the maximum coverage amount of US$300,000, the maximum monthly premium payment will be US$85.20. The up-to-date information on the rates is available at: https://www.un.org/insurance/content/life-insurance.  The premium rate is determined by The Hartford  in consultation with the UN.  Payment  The premium is paid in full by the staff member.   No subsidy is paid by the Organization.  The monthly premium is payable in US dollars in advance at the beginning of each month and is effected by means of automatic payroll deduction.    The premium for staff who are paid in currencies other than US dollars is based on their pensionable remuneration in the local currency and is then converted to US dollars, using the UN official rate of exchange, and remitted to the insurance company in US dollars.  Benefits payable by the insurance company will be the equivalent in US dollars, converted at the UN official rate of exchange at the time of payment, of the entitlement of the participant in local currency.  Records  The office must maintain a record of the amounts collected for locally recruited staff members, should there be any questions or audit at a later date.   Automatic adjustment of coverage level and premium  The level of coverage and the corresponding premium will automatically be adjusted whenever an increase in pensionable remuneration occurs, unless:  The pensionable remuneration of the staff member already entitles them to the maximum coverage available; or   The staff member has executed a waiver of automatic increase prior to 1 January 2001.  A participant who does not wish to accept the increased life insurance coverage resulting from changes in their pensionable remuneration must cancel their coverage under the plan.  In order to reinstate life insurance participation at a future date, a new application must be made through the “evidence of insurability” process. Discontinuance of waiver of premium increase  In the past, staff were given an opportunity to waive the increase, thereby freezing life insurance coverage at the prior level.  With effect from 1 January 2001, the option to waive the coverage increase was discontinued. The life insurance level of staff that executed a waiver of automatic increase prior to 1 January 2001 will be maintained at the lower coverage level. Reapplication after cancellation of coverage  A staff member who has cancelled coverage may re-apply at a later date for coverage based on their pensionable remuneration at that time.  Enrolment in the plan is conditional on the provision, by the staff member at the time of application, of evidence of insurability satisfactory to The Hartford.  The Hartford  reserves the right to reject any reapplication and may require the applicant to undergo a medical examination at the applicant’s own expense.  If reapplication is accepted, coverage begins from the date The Hartford gives its written consent.   Special Leave without Pay  Periods of special leave without pay (SLWOP) for less than one calendar month do not affect the coverage to which the staff member has subscribed.  For periods of leave that exceed one month, staff members have the option of continuing coverage by making full payment of the premiums involved, in advance, on a quarterly basis, as follows:  For  local staff members stationed in New York, and international staff members contact the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS) to arrange for payment of premiums   For local staff members stationed outside New York, arrange payments through the Human Resources/Operations Manager at the duty station.  Staff members who choose not to retain coverage during a period of special leave without pay (SLWOP) of more than two months’ duration, may re-enrol in the plan only on the basis of satisfactory evidence of insurability. Retroactive payment of premiums for a period of SLWOP in order to become entitled to after-service coverage will not be accepted.   Transfer between payrolling duty stations and employing organizations, and breaks in service It should be noted that there is no automatic continuation of coverage when a staff member:  Transfers from one payrolling duty station to another.   Moves from one employing organization to another; or    Is reappointed after a break in service  Therefore, to ensure continuity of coverage in the plan, staff members must make arrangements to re-enrol upon:  Transfer to a new payrolling duty station  Change of employing organization; or   Reappointment after a break in service  To be assured of unbroken life insurance coverage, re-enrolment in the life insurance plan must be accomplished no later than two months following the date of transfer or reappointment; otherwise, an evidence of insurability statement will be required. Designation of beneficiary  Since life insurance benefits are payable to the participant’s beneficiary, it is most important for each participant in the plan to designate the person or persons to whom the participant wishes the benefit to be paid.  For the payment of benefits, the insurance company recognizes only the most recent, properly executed form for the designation of beneficiaries.  It is the responsibility of the staff member or former staff member to make sure that the proper person or persons are designated, particularly after death, divorce, or other changes in the relationship between the person or persons previously designated and the staff member or former staff member.  Changes in the designation of beneficiaries may be made at any time.   The appropriate Designation of Beneficiary form (Designation of Beneficiary Form)  () must be forwarded to:  For  local staff members stationed in New York, and international staff members, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the organizational unit, for onforwarding to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS);   if a local staff member stationed outside New York, the Human Resources/Operations Manager at the duty station concerned.  The form is kept locally, and a copy is sent to GSSC in Copenhagen. The form does not need to be forwarded to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS).  Legal agreements  After enrolment, the participant may enter into any of the following legal agreements:  Creditor Designation of Beneficiary, which may be used, for example, to secure a loan  Irrevocable Designation of Beneficiary, which may be used, for example, in divorce or related proceedings  Assignment of Group Coverage, which may be used, for example, for tax purposes, in consultation with a legal adviser (not the Organization or The Hartford)  If the participant wishes to enter into any of the above legal agreements, the applicable form must be sent to:  For local staff members stationed in New York and International staff members, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the organizational unit, for onforwarding to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS) who will forward it to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS) for processing before The Hartford. If a local staff member stationed outside New York, the Human Resources/Operations Manager at the duty station concerned, who will forward it to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS) for processing before The Hartford  Claims Filing a claim  All claims must be processed through the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (HLIS) at: hlis@un.org to The Hartford for processing. Proceeds are issued separately to each beneficiary and/or to the guardian of the estate of a minor child who is a beneficiary. UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS) will then communicate directly with the beneficiaries or their authorized representatives.  Claims or notification of claims should not be transmitted directly to The Hartford.  In the event of death of a staff member who participated in the GLI program, a notification must be sent to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS) by:   For local staff members stationed in New York and International staff members, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the organizational unit, for onforwarding to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS)   For local staff members stationed outside New York, the Human Resources/Operations Manager at the duty station concerned  When notifying the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS), the following documentation must be provided:  All insurance application forms, including initial and re-enrolment, where applicable  Evidence of insurability records, where applicable  Appropriate forms changing the beneficiary designation  Payroll records documenting the deduction of group life insurance premiums or the direct payment by staff member during periods of SLWOP  Certification by the OHR Human Resources Specialist or local Human Resources/ Operations Manager of:  The last day the staff member reported to work  Close of business (COB) separation date  Date of the last premium deduction and, in the base currency, amount of premium and level of pensionable remuneration for the last full month of service  The UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS), will send a letter to the beneficiary with instructions and detailing the additional required documentation, which includes:  The original or a legally certified copy of the insured’s death certificate (a death certificate furnished to the UN Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF) will not suffice for life insurance purposes). Information on the UNJSPF can be downloaded from their website: http://www.unjspf.org.  Official medical certification as to the cause of death, when not stated on the death certificate  Completed UN group life insurance programme beneficiary certification forms. There are two forms available at https://www.un.org/insurance/content/life-insurance:  For those beneficiaries who do not have US Social Security and do not reside in the USA  For those who reside in the USA  Additional documentation (such as court-ordered documents or English translations) may be required in circumstances where:  A beneficiary is deceased, a copy of the beneficiary’s death certificate.  If all beneficiaries are deceased, evidence of the legally recognized appointment of the person designated to administer the assets/property (referred to as “estate” under US law) of the insured. Or, should any beneficiary die after the insured but before a claim is paid, court papers appointing a person to administer the “estate” of that beneficiary.  Should there be no corresponding legal concept under applicable national laws, proceeds will be paid to the estate of the insured (or of the beneficiary) and those closest to the deceased may seek documents under their national law governing the line of legal succession, permitting a bank to accept a deposit of a benefit cheque.  Beneficiaries have not reached the age of majority, the legally recognized appointment of the guardian of the “estate” (assets/property) of the minor child.  Where such guardian is a surviving parent living outside the US, a copy of the national law governing minor children, stating that the surviving parent automatically becomes the guardian of the property of a minor child and setting out the age of majority, along with a copy of the child’s birth certificate establishing the names of the father and the mother, may be submitted in lieu of court papers.  Oaths sworn before a notary do not satisfy the requirements of The Hartford’s legal department.  Death may be considered accidental, the official police report, setting out the circumstances that resulted in the death of the insured (inter alia, the time of day, weather conditions, testimony of eyewitnesses, diagrams) and any autopsy statement/medical report.   Death occurs within two years of the approval date indicated on an evidence of insurability statement, all medical records for the previous five years.     Payment  GLIP is a global plan, administered on a highly decentralized basis, and gathering all documentation and records required to process a claim could take some time.  Following submission of all required documentation to The Hartford, the beneficiary will normally receive life insurance proceeds within three to four weeks directly from The Hartford.  Method  Each beneficiary will receive an individual cheque (principal amount plus interest earned) by a secure mode of delivery.  The Hartford  benefit cheques have no expiry date.  It should be noted that The Hartford does not deposit benefit proceeds directly into bank accounts.  Currency of payment  Payment will be made in US dollars.  Staff paid in currencies other than US dollars  Benefits payable by The Hartford  will be the equivalent in US dollars of the entitlement of the participant in local currency converted at the UN official rate of exchange, in effect on the date of the event giving rise to the claim.  US taxes  The life insurance principal payable to individuals is exempt from all US taxes. The tax exemption does not apply if life insurance proceeds are paid to an estate that is subject to US taxes.    Interests  Life insurance benefits, upon the death of the insured, earn interest at a rate determined by The Hartford until the date on which proceeds are paid to beneficiaries.  Unlike the life insurance principal, interest earned may be subject to taxation.  Group life insurance participants may wish to note that there is no prescribed timeframe for submitting claims. After-Service Life Insurance (ASLI) After-service benefits  To become eligible for post-retirement life insurance benefits, staff members must have been active participants in the life insurance programme prior to their separation from service.  No application is necessary to qualify for after-service coverage for active participants.  Under ASLI, retirees will receive free life insurance coverage without paying any additional premiums, however, the additional coverage for accidental death or dismemberment ceases after separation from service. Furthermore, the level of coverage will be reduced according to the age of the plan participant.  Free coverage  Staff members who are participants in the group life insurance plan and have at least 10 years contributory participation upon their separation from UNDP, shall receive continuing basic life insurance coverage, without payment of premium, as follows:  Prior to age 55:          One year’s free coverage at the level in effect at the time of separation for each completed 10-year period of contributory participation   At the end of this period of free coverage, the life insurance coverage ceases unless the participant either again becomes a staff member and renews their participation in the plan, if eligible, or makes arrangements with The Hartford to continue coverage under the conversion option (see Conversion Privileges section)  From age 55:  Between ages 55 and 69, coverage on separation from service is 50 percent of the level of coverage in effect at the time of separation   Between ages 70 and 74, coverage is 25 percent of the level of coverage in effect at the time of separation   From age 75, coverage is 10 percent of the level of coverage in effect at the time of separation.  The minimum after 75 is the lesser of US$5,000 or the amount to which the after-service participant would be entitled before age 75.  The maximum after age 75 is US$10,000.    The reduction to US$150,000 at age 62, while still in service, will be ignored in these calculations.  In the case of those participants who signed a waiver of automatic increase in coverage prior to 1 January 2001, the date on which the waiver option expires, free life insurance coverage will be based on the level of coverage in effect on the date of separation from service, rather than the full amount that he/she was eligible for.  Staff terminated for reasons of health in accordance with UN Staff Regulation 9.1 (a) are eligible to receive free life insurance coverage equal to their coverage on the date of separation, up to age 65.  After 65, the percentage factors set out in paragraph 70 apply. Documentation required for After-Service Insurance GSSC will  submit the following group life insurance documentation to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (UN HLIS) whenever an insured staff member separates from service in order to establish the entitlement to ASLI benefits:  All insurance application forms, including initial and re-enrolment, where applicable    Evidence of insurability records, where applicable  Appropriate forms changing the beneficiary designation  Termination of life insurance records, where applicable  Payroll records documenting the deduction of group life insurance premiums or the direct payment by staff member during periods of SLWOP  Certification of:  The last day the staff member reported to work  Close of business (cob) separation date  Date of the last premium deduction and, in the base currency, amount of premium and level of pensionable remuneration for the last full month of service Discontinuance of accidental death & dismemberment coverage   There is no after-service coverage for accidental death or dismemberment; therefore, this portion of the insurance plan terminates at the end of the month in which the staff member separates from service. Re-employment of retired staff  Under the after-service health insurance programme (ASHI), if, as a result of a new post-retirement appointment, a former staff member again becomes a participant in the Pension Fund, the monthly pension benefit is suspended and, for the duration of this suspension, eligibility for the ASHI programme is also suspended.  In the case of the After-Life Insurance Programme (ASLI), though, there is no link with Pension Fund status and, therefore, a post-retirement appointment of any duration with the Organization does not lead to a suspension of benefits under ASLI.  Suspension of ASLI will occur only if a former staff member is eligible and elects to re-enrol in the life insurance programme for the period of re-employment.  Assessment should be made as to whether the level of coverage as a premium-paying staff member or the ASLI benefit is more advantageous.  Except for periods of optional re-enrolment, the ASLI entitlement remains in effect. Conversion privileges Conversion to individual coverage  All staff members who, at the time of their separation from service, are participating in the plan may make arrangements directly with The Hartford  to convert to an individual policy under conditions established by The Hartford, without having to produce further evidence of insurability.  The premium rate schedule pertaining to the conversion life insurance policy is age-based and bears no relationship to the premium structure of the UN group life insurance plan.  The participant is then solely responsible for paying and remitting the premiums to The Hartford.  Inquiries as to contract terms and premium payment instructions, as well as completed applications, should be directed to The Hartford.  The amount of life insurance that may be converted is based on the level of coverage at the time of separation, as follows:  Staff members under age 55 or those with fewer than 10 years of contribution participation in the plan may convert up to the full amount of their life insurance at separation  Staff members who separate before age 55 and who qualify for a year of free coverage for each 10 years of contribution participation may convert up to that amount at the end of the period of free coverage  Staff members over 55 who qualify for ASLI may convert with The Hartford to an individual policy, the amount of the decrease in coverage at separation or, as ASLI participants, at ages 70 and 75.  For example, if a staff member has US$100,000 of coverage at separation, the ASLI benefit would be US$50,000.  In this case, the staff member may convert up to the US$50,000 difference in coverage.  When the former staff member reaches age 70 and the after-service benefit drops to US$25,000, he/she may convert the US$25,000 difference between the new level and the prior US$50,000 ASLI level.    The conversion privilege must be exercised within 31 days:  Following termination of coverage under the UN plan; or   The date on which the ASLI coverage is reduced as the participant grows older.

    "harassment-sexual-harassment-discrimination-and-abuse-authority": " Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority  1.0\tRegulations and Rules \t This policy implements UN Staff Rule 1.2 (f).   2.0\tPolicy   UNDP is committed to creating and maintaining a working environment that respects the inherent dignity of all persons, affording them the opportunity to reach their fullest potential and empowering them to deliver the best possible results for UNDP and the people we serve.  Every person working for UNDP has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, and to work in a safe environment free from harassment, sexual harassment, abuse, and discrimination.  UNDP does not, and will not, tolerate harassment, sexual harassment, discrimination, and abuse of authority in any form. Such conduct is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations, the UN Staff Regulations and Rules and the Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service, and will be dealt with promptly, justly and effectively in accordance with this policy. Staff Rule 1.2 (f) provides that \"any form of discrimination or harassment, including sexual or gender harassment, as well as physical or verbal abuse at the workplace or in connection with work, is prohibited.\" UNDP personnel exhibiting such behaviour or conduct may be subject to administrative, disciplinary or contractual measures, up to and including dismissal, as appropriate.  It is also the policy of UNDP, as set out in the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation, that retaliation by any member of UNDP’s personnel against another member of UNDP’s personnel for having, in good faith, properly reported allegations of misconduct, or for having cooperated with a duly authorized audit or investigation, is strictly prohibited. Such retaliation violates the fundamental obligation of all UNDP personnel to uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity as required under the UN Charter, and to discharge their functions and regulate their conduct in accordance with these standards. Retaliation, as defined under the UNDP Protection against Retaliation Policy, is itself misconduct and will be treated accordingly.  3.0 \tApplication  This policy applies to all UNDP personnel. The prohibition against harassment, sexual harassment, discrimination, and abuse of authority extends to conduct which occurs at the workplace, during or outside working hours.  \tProhibited conduct   For the purposes of this policy, harassment, sexual harassment, discrimination and abuse of authority are referred to collectively as “prohibited conduct”. Additional guidance is provided in Annex 3, which includes examples of specific behaviours constituting prohibited conduct.  Harassment is any improper and unwelcome conduct by UNDP personnel against UNDP or external personnel that has caused, or that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause, offence or humiliation.   Harassment may be present in the form of words, gestures, electronic communication or other actions that annoy, alarm, abuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, or cause personal humiliation or embarrassment to another, or cause an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. It includes but is not limited to harassment based on any grounds, such as race, religion, color, creed, ethnic origin, physical attributes, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Harassment will often consist of a series of incidents, but it may be brought about by a single incident only.  The mere expression of disagreement, admonishment, criticism or similar action regarding work performance, conduct or related issues within a supervisory relationship shall not be considered prohibited conduct. Such work-related disagreement is dealt with under the provisions of the Performance Management and Development (PMD) Policy.  Sexual Harassment is a form of harassment and is any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favour, verbal or physical conduct or gesture of a sexual nature, or any other behaviour of a sexual nature that has or that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offense or humiliation.  Sexual harassment may result in an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment or is made a condition of employment. Sexual harassment normally implies a series of incidents. However, a one-time incident could fall within the definition of sexual harassment if it has an unambiguously offensive sexual character. Staff members with any gender identity can be either the injured party or the offender.  Discrimination is any unfair treatment or arbitrary distinction based on a person’s race, sex, gender identity, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, pregnancy, age, language, social origin or other status. Discrimination may be an isolated event affecting one person or a group of persons similarly situated, or may manifest itself through harassment or abuse of authority.   Abuse of authority is the improper use of a position of influence, power or authority by UNDP personnel against UNDP or external personnel or a group thereof. This includes situations when the person in question uses their influence, power or authority to arbitrarily influence the career or employment conditions (including, but not limited to, appointment, assignment, contract renewal, performance evaluation or promotion) of other UNDP or external personnel.  Abuse of authority can include a one-time incident or a series of incidents. It may also consist of conduct that creates a hostile or offensive work environment, which includes, but is not limited to, the use of intimidation, threats, blackmail or coercion.  Retaliation is any direct or indirect detrimental action recommended, threatened or taken against an individual because that individual engaged in a “Protected Activity” as defined in the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation. Interim and permanent protective measures may also be implemented to ensure the victim of retaliation is shielded from current or future threats or acts of retribution. However, the legitimate application of regulations, rules or administrative policies, issuances or procedures, or the mere expression of disagreement, admonishment, criticism or a similar expression regarding work performance, conduct or related issues within a supervisory or similar relationship, do not constitute Retaliation. Retaliation is itself a separate act of misconduct and a violation of the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation.   For the purposes of this policy, prohibited conduct does not include sexual exploitation and abuse. Sexual exploitation is any actual or attempted abuse by UNDP personnel of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. Similarly, sexual abuse means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature by UNDP personnel, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. All cases of sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) are specifically addressed under the Secretary-General Bulletin ST/SGB/2003/13: Special Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse.  5.0\tResponsibilities of UNDP personnel  UNDP personnel must:  Be respectful to others and maintain the highest standards of conduct;  Maintain a harmonious working environment by behaving in a manner that is free of intimidation, hostility, offence and any form of prohibited conduct;  Familiarize themselves with UNDP’s policies, including an understanding of what constitutes prohibited conduct. In addition, UNDP personnel must take mandatory courses related to prohibited conduct, as determined by the Organization.   Be aware of the various options and internal channels available to them for reporting and/or otherwise addressing such behaviours; and  Respect confidentiality and fully cooperate with those responsible for investigating reports of prohibited conduct under this policy.  6.0\tResponsibilities of Managers and Supervisors  Managers and Supervisors have special obligations to prevent and deter prohibited conduct and must:  Create a safe and harmonious working environment, free of intimidation, hostility, offence and any form of prohibited conduct. In order to achieve such an environment, managers and supervisors must act as role models by upholding only the highest standards of conduct.  Communicate the present policy to all UNDP personnel, ensure that they take relevant mandatory courses and certification, and act as a resource for UNDP personnel and external personnel.    Address, report and escalate alleged incidents of prohibited conduct consistent with the present policy.   Ensure that incidents of prohibited conduct are promptly addressed through appropriate channels. In such cases, managers and supervisors must demonstrate fairness, impartiality, and be free from intimidation or favouritism; managers should not attempt to pre-investigate allegations.  Ensure that all discussions, communications and actions are handled with extreme discretion, sensitivity and utmost confidentiality; and  Ensure appropriate action is taken to prevent UNDP personnel from retaliation.  All Directors of Bureaus and Heads of Offices are required to provide an annual certificate to the Administrator confirming that during the preceding year they have discussed with all UNDP personnel under their management or supervision their rights and responsibilities under this policy and the courses of action and sources of support that are available to them.   While consensual, intimate relationships between UNDP personnel are generally not prohibited, managers and supervisors should recognize that such relationships are not appropriate where one person manages, reviews or takes administrative decisions concerning the other person, is subordinate to the other person in the same line of reporting/authority, or is in a position in which some other conflict of interest may arise. Such relationships may, among others, have negative repercussions on the morale of the office, and lead to allegations of favoritism. They may also lead to complaints of sexual harassment if the relationship sours and the subordinate person alleges that they were coerced into the relationship. The parties to any such relationship must disclose in writing to the next level up in their management and may consult the Ethics Office for advice.    The failure of a manager or supervisor to address any known or reasonably suspected act of prohibited conduct may result in the imposition of appropriate administrative or disciplinary measures on the manager or supervisor.  8.0\tResponsibilities of UNDP  UNDP shall make available appropriate learning resources to all UNDP personnel to ensure awareness of key provisions of this policy, standards of conduct, values and forms.  UNDP will ensure that timely and appropriate action — including action to protect the safety and well-being of the complainant— is taken when prohibited conduct is reported.   UNDP will take timely and appropriate measures to protect UNDP personnel from retaliation for reporting prohibited conduct, when such protection is sought. Such measures may include the temporary or permanent suspension of the action alleged to be retaliatory, the temporary or permanent transfer of the accused or the complainant. Disciplinary action, when warranted, will be taken against UNDP personnel found to have engaged in retaliation.  9.0 \tResponsibilities of the Complainant   Anonymous reporting by complainants is permitted under this policy. Complainants should be aware that anonymous reporting may make it more difficult for investigators to thoroughly investigate the allegations – despite their best efforts.     The complaint must be made in good faith, which means that the person reporting the allegations of prohibited conduct must have a reasonable belief that misconduct has occurred. Intentionally making a false report, verbally or in writing, constitutes misconduct for which disciplinary measures may be imposed.  10.0\tReporting of prohibited conduct   To report prohibited conduct, UNDP or external personnel may wish to first contact the Office of the Ombudsman who can guide them on their options under the current policy. Contacting the Office of the Ombudsman will not affect the right of UNDP personnel to file a formal complaint with OAI at any time. Sexual harassment may also be reported to the external sexual harassment helpline where the counseling and guidance on the process will be provided. See Annex I for details on how to contact these offices.        Alternatively, UNDP personnel can contact OAI directly.   There is no time limit for reporting sexual harassment. Complainants are strongly encouraged to report cases as soon as possible after the incident has occurred. Early reporting is critical to the success of any investigation and may significantly contribute to UNDP’s ability to address the allegations.   All reports of sexual harassment will be prioritised by OAI.  OAI is responsible for conducting preliminary assessments and investigations of complaints of prohibited conduct.   If an individual believes that another person in UNDP has taken, or is threatening to take, retaliatory action against them or another colleague because of their good faith report of wrongdoing, or cooperation with an audit or investigation, they may submit a Request for Protection to the Ethics Office. All supporting documentation and evidence, together with the names of individuals who may be able to support the allegation, should be included. The complainant will be protected from retaliation, in accordance with the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation.  11.0\tDispute Resolution Processes  UNDP and external personnel have several options available to them to report prohibited conduct and seek resolution through formal or informal processes.   Different dispute resolution processes are included in Table 1 below:    It is strongly advised that all parties maintain detailed written records (including hard copies of e-mails), of all incidents, dates, places and witnesses. All parties should note that not all informal processes are successful and that an investigation may occur in the future, and therefore written records would prove useful should any more formal steps be taken.  If UNDP personnel, are notified of a decision (which may be administrative or disciplinary in nature) and believe that decision is motivated by the prohibited conduct, the individual  can formally contest the decision by: i) for staff members: requesting a management evaluation of the decision, in accordance with the appeals procedures available to UNDP staff members under the UN Staff Regulations, and Staff Rule 11.2, or ii) for other members of UNDP personnel, the dispute resolution mechanism provided for in their contracts.   12.0\tAdditional provisions  Separation of the alleged offender. It may happen during the investigation process that the alleged offender separates from UNDP. OAI, in its discretion will determine whether the investigation will be pursued despite the separation from service of the alleged offender. OAI will attempt to finalise all investigations into allegations of sexual harassment. Where the investigation into prohibited conduct has been finalised, and LO considers the allegations substantiated, LO will notify the alleged offender and place a note in the Official Status File of the individual in question, after giving him/her the opportunity to provide comments on the matter, indicating the recommended action that would have been taken had the alleged offender remained employed. Notes on the Official Status File will be shared if the individual is being considered for any type of employment or contract with UNDP. UNDP may share the letter with a prospective employer which is a partner of UNDP if a reference is requested. Where the investigation has not been finalised, LO will notify the alleged offender and place a note in the Official Status File of the individual in question indicating that the individual separated while under investigation, after giving him/her the opportunity to provide comments on the matter. Such notes will not be shared with parties for reference purposes outside UNDP.    Investigation without a formal complaint. the Administrator or Associate Administrator may refer to OAI that such an investigation be undertaken, and the Director, OAI, reserves the right to initiate an investigation into allegations of prohibited conduct at his/her own initiative, including without reference to a formal complaint.  Non-UNDP complainant or alleged offender. In the event that the complainant belongs to another UN agency, fund, programme or subsidiary organ but files a complaint against UNDP personnel, the present policy will apply. Consultations will be held between UNDP and the other Organization concerned about the handling of the case. If the complainant is UNDP personnel but files a complaint against an employee of another UN agency, fund, programme or subsidiary organ, the present policy will not apply to the alleged offender, but UNDP will use best efforts to ensure that the interests of its personnel are protected by the other Organization.  Non-UNDP staff administered by UNDP. In the event that the complainant or the alleged offender is administered by UNDP on behalf of another UN agency, fund, programme or subsidiary organ, UNDP will verify with that Organization whether the present policy applies or whether the policy from that Organization applies.  Referral to Local Authorities. In cases of compelling emergency or danger, prohibited conduct must be reported to local authorities by the complainant, after which the matter must immediately be also reported to LO/BMS. In all other cases, bringing a matter to the attention of local authorities requires the prior concurrence of LO/BMS, which liaises with UN Office of Legal Affairs (UN/OLA), since it involves issues of privileges and immunities. Should it become apparent that the alleged act of prohibited conduct constitutes a breach of local laws, LO/BMS must be informed and will undertake appropriate action.   Annex 1.

Discrimination  Discrimination may be an isolated event affecting one person or a group of persons similarly situated, or may manifest itself through harassment or abuse of authority.   Any of the examples of harassment and abuse of authority above, when based on the person’s race, sex, gender identity, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, pregnancy, age, language, social origin or other status, also constitute discrimination.  Examples of discrimination include:  Not recommending or considering an employee for promotion or other advancement, or treating someone differently for any other purpose, e.g., development opportunities, working overtime, vacation, hours of work, exclusion from meetings, etc. because of race, sex, gender identity, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, pregnancy, age, language, social origin or other status; Derogatory or offensive nicknames based on a person’s race, sex, gender identity, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, pregnancy, age, language, social origin or other status; Demeaning comments about a person’s language, dress, or physical characteristics.

",
    "home-leave": " Home Leave  The purpose of the Home Leave (HL) travel entitlement is to allow eligible internationally recruited staff members periodic visits to their home country to renew and strengthen cultural and family ties. Having a multicultural staff is a founding principle of our international civil service. The UN invests in maintaining its multicultural nature through the HL entitlement.  HL does not carry any extra entitlement to days of leave beyond the normal annual leave entitlement. The time spent on HL is charged against the staff member’s normal annual leave entitlement. Absence on HL is subject to the exigencies of service, as determined and approved by the staff member’s supervisor.  Eligibility  Internationally recruited staff members holding a Permanent, Continuing or Fixed-Term Appointment are eligible for HL, provided the staff member:  is serving and residing in a duty station that is outside of the country of the staff member’s nationality for UN purposes and/or the place of HL;  has completed the qualifying service time requirements and accrual of HL points, as specified in the paragraphs below; and  returns to the duty station from HL with a minimum of six months remaining before the expiration of the staff member’s contract, or three months remaining before the expiration of contract if serving in a duty station with a 12- month HL cycle;  in the case of the first HL, has at least six months of service remaining before the expiration of contract beyond the date on which the staff member will have accrued 24 points, or three months if serving in a duty station with a 12-month HL cycle.   An internationally recruited staff member is not eligible for HL when the staff member:  is serving and residing in the country recognized as the staff member’s country of nationality for UN purposes, in accordance with Staff Rule 4.3;  is serving and residing in the country where the staff member is exceptionally authorized to retain permanent resident status, in accordance with Staff Rule 4.5 (d); or   is serving and residing in the country recognized as the staff member’s place of HL.  Special provisions  Staff members holding a Temporary Appointment will only be eligible for HL and only in respect of themselves if their appointment is exceptionally extended beyond 364 days, they serve in a duty station with a 12-month HL cycle and they meet all other requirements mentioned above.  Staff members who are a native of a non-metropolitan territory of the country of the duty station (example: Samoa, USA; La Réunion, France) and who maintained their normal residence in the non-metropolitan territory prior to their appointment may also be eligible, provided that they continue to reside, while performing their official duties, outside this territory.  Frequency of Home Leave   The Home Leave frequency of a duty station is determined by its Hardship classification and whether the duty station falls within the ICSC Rest and Recuperation Framework, as follows:  Duty stations classified as H, A, B and C are entitled to home leave travel once in every 24 months;  Duty stations classified as D and E that fall within the ICSC Rest and Recuperation Framework are entitled to home leave travel once in every 24 months; and  Duty stations which are classified as D or E but which do not benefit from Rest and Recuperation travel are entitled to home leave travel every 12 months.  Home Leave service credit points system  A home-leave service credit point system is used to determine when Home Leave is due. A staff member accrues home leave points on the basis of the number of calendar months of service from the date of initial appointment or from the date that the individual becomes eligible for, and entitled to, Home Leave:   Staff members serving in a 24-month duty station earn one point each month (i.e. 24 credit points in two years of service).   Staff members serving in a 12-month duty station earn two points each month (i.e. 24 credit points in one year of service).  Fractions of months: staff members who arrive at a duty station on the 1st to 15th of the month, will accrue points at the new duty station’s points rate; staff members who arrive between the 16th and end of the month, will accrue at the previous duty station’s points rate. When an entitlement becomes effective between the 16th and the end of the month, the counting of Home Leave points starts from the following month.  Staff members are entitled to Home Leave when they have accrued 24 points. When they exercise Home Leave, 24 points are deducted from their balance, and they continue to accrue points.  If the staff member defers Home Leave, the staff member may accrue a maximum of 48 points. If the staff member does not take Home Leave after accumulating 48 points, accrual of points is discontinued until the entitlement to home leave is exercised.  In the event of inter-agency transfers, loans or secondments of staff from other UN agencies which do not have a system of home leave credit points, UNDP home leave credits are applied from the date of return from the last home leave taken in the releasing organization.  Interval between Home Leaves  For staff members serving at a 24-month Home Leave cycle duty station, at least 12 months should elapse between one HL and the next HL.   For staff members serving in a duty station with a 12-month Home Leave cycle at least six months should elapse between one Home Leave travel and the next one.  The interval between Home Leave travels is normally determined from the date of return from the previous Home Leave travel. In case the family travels independently of the staff member, such interval is determined from the date of return from HL of the first traveler.  Advance Home Leave  On application, a staff member may be granted advance home leave (i.e. prior to the accrual of the necessary number of points).   A negative point(s) balance shall be recorded in such cases, up to a maximum of minus 12 points. A staff member must accrue the requisite points to off-set the negative balance and must then accrue the requisite 24 points before the next Home Leave can be granted.   The granting of advance Home Leave does not bring forward the date of subsequent Home Leave entitlements except in cases due to exigencies of service.   Advance Home Leave shall be approved on the understanding that the staff member will subsequently meet all the conditions to be eligible. Should this prove not to be the case, the staff member must reimburse any costs UNDP may have had.  Country of Home Leave  As per UN Staff Rule 5.4, the country of Home Leave is normally the country of the staff member’s nationality. Under delegated authority, the Director of OHR, determines the nationality of new recruits at the time of appointment.   A staff member’s country of Home Leave is determined at the time of appointment. A country other than the country of nationality may be designated as the country of HL provided that:  The staff member continues to have close family, cultural or personal ties in that country at the time of appointment; and  The staff member established residence in that country for a prolonged period (minimum of five years) preceding the staff member’s appointment. Staff members who are exceptionally authorized to retain permanent residence status in a country other than the country of nationality recognized for UN purposes will have the country of permanent residence status established as the place of Home Leave).  Once determined, the country of Home Leave may not be changed unless:  There was an error in the initial determination, provided the request for rectification is made before the staff member exercises the first Home Leave;  There is a subsequent change in nationality recognized by the Director of OHR as the official UN nationality; or  There are other valid and compelling reasons, approved by the Director of OHR, which are consistent with the conditions set out above.  Recognized Home Leave place  The recognized Home Leave place is the city or town within the recognized country of Home Leave to which a staff member travels on HL. The place of HL is always indicated on the staff member’s personnel action form.  A one-time permanent change to a different city or town within the recognized country of Home Leave may be authorized by the Director of OHR, based on personal and family needs.   A temporary change in the place of HL may be authorized by OHR in the case of widespread political disorder, insecurity, civil war or other armed insurrection in the recognized Home Leave location and security clearance cannot be obtained by the staff member and/or eligible family (see paragraphs 30-33 below). In such cases, the amount of travel expenses payable by UNDP shall not exceed the cost of travel to the regular place of HL.  If the situation persists, the Home Leave travel of the staff member may continue to be authorized to such other country.  For staff members on transfer, loan or secondment to UNDP, their place of HL remains the same as that determined by the releasing organization.  Travel destination   Staff members are expected to exercise their HL at their officially recognized place of HL.   Without departing from the basic purpose of the entitlement, eligible staff members are able to take HL travel in the way best suited to their personal and family needs. The intention is to recognize situations where staff members and their families are of multicultural backgrounds and also where, during the course of their careers, they have established cultural/family ties in places other than their country of nationality.  Under UN Staff Rule 5.4, travel to a country or place of HL other than the country of HL or place of HL may be authorized, provided the staff member has close family or personal ties in the other country. In such cases, the amount of travel expenses payable by UNDP shall not exceed the cost of travel to the recognized place of Home Leave. In alternate years, the staff member must take home leave in the recognized country/place.  Home Leave area and security clearance  Home leave travel is subject to security clearance through the UN Security Management System.  Certain limitations may apply based on a determination by the Designated Official for security. These restrictions may affect whether dependent children, spouses or staff may travel to a location on Home Leave.   Authorized Home Leave travel does not overrule a decision by the Designated Official restricting travel to a location. Staff members may have their HL affected at any time before or during Home Leave travel.  If a security evacuation is declared in the area where the staff member and/or eligible family members are exercising Home Leave, they are subject to the same security instructions that are applicable to other international staff members present in the area.  Length of stay  Staff members and their eligible family members are required to spend no less than seven calendar days, excluding travel time credit, but including the day of arrival and the day of departure in the country of their HL destination. A reduction of the length of stay may be approved for reasons of personal or professional exigencies.  Home Leave of eligible family members  Eligible family members do not have a Home Leave entitlement independent of the staff member. However, eligible family members may travel separately from the staff member provided that travel is to the staff member's recognized place of HL.  When eligible dependents and staff members travel separately, HL points will accrue or be deducted from the month the first eligible dependent travels. Staff members may travel at a later date based on this entitlement with no further impact on the accounting of points, provided they meet the required months of service when returning from HL.   When a staff member and eligible family members travel separately, the interval between their travels shall not exceed one year.  Reverse Home Leave for family members  Eligible dependents will not be authorized to travel for HL from their home country to another country.  Children born or adopted while parent is on Home Leave  When a child is born or adopted while the birth parent is on HL, UNDP will pay, in respect of the newborn child, whichever of the following two costs is lower:   Travel from the staff member’s officially recognized HL place to the duty station; or   Travel from the place where the birth/adoptive parent exercised HL to the duty station.   Cost  Irrespective of where the staff member and eligible family members exercise the Home Leave travel, UNDP will only pay, whichever of the following two costs is lower: Travel from duty station to staff member’s officially recognized HL place and back to duty station; or Travel from duty station to the place where HL is exercised and back to duty station. Retroactive claims may be accepted within one year of eligibility, subject to presentation of proof of travel/cost. In such case reimbursement is based on the lower of actual cost and lump sum. Home Leave lump sum  The HL travel entitlement is normally paid as a lump sum amount.  Staff members will receive a lump sum amount equivalent to 75 per cent of the cost of the unrestricted economy fare by the least costly scheduled air carrier and by the most direct route.  The lump sum option for Home Leave travel cannot be retroactively approved.  However, reimbursement on actual costs (subject to the maximum cost of lump sum) may be considered upon request with submission of documentary proof of travel within one year.   Staff members who travel by other means (e.g. car/train) are entitled to 20% of the cost of the unrestricted economy fare by the least costly scheduled air carrier and by the most direct route.   Home Leave travel arranged and paid for by the Organization  Organization-assisted HL travel may be chosen by the staff member when this is the best option to support the ability to utilize the entitlement.   For staff members who have chosen the Organization assisted HL travel option, travel is in economy class, irrespective of the duration of the flight.   The flight class for HL travel for staff members and eligible family members at the Under-Secretary General (USG) and Assistant Secretary- General (ASG) levels will be in the class immediately below first class, irrespective of the duration of the flight.   Children studying away from the duty station  Children studying away from the duty station may initiate HL travel from the  educational institution. In this case, UNDP will only pay whichever of the following  two costs is lower: From the staff member’s official duty station to the staff member’s officially recognized place of Home Leave and return; or From the educational institution to the place where HL travel is exercised and return. Interval between entitlement-related travels  A minimum of three months is normally required between entitlement-related travels (e.g. reverse education grant travel - EGT), counting from the date of return to the duty station from one travel to the date of departure of the next travel. The three-month interval may be reduced, however, to allow regular EGT (where child is travelling) to take place in the same year as HL travel (if eligible).  However, for those duty stations with a Rest and Recuperation (R&R) travel frequency of less than 12 weeks, the normal minimum three-month interval for entitlement-related travels (e.g. reverse EGT) is reduced to two months. Combination with reassignment or other travel  A staff member is expected to undertake Home Leave travel in conjunction with reassignment or other official entitlement travel. Staff not availing themselves of Home Leave or other entitlement travel in conjunction with reassignment must comply with the three months interval between entitlement travels and spend at least three months in the duty station before travel on Home Leave can be approved.  Both spouses are UN staff members eligible for home leave  Each staff member has the choice of either exercising the staff member’s own Home Leave entitlement or of taking it as the spouse of the other. The dependent children may take Home Leave under either parent, regardless of which parent is entitled to the dependency benefits. If the staff member takes HL as a spouse, UNDP will only pay whichever of the following three costs is lower: travel from the UNDP staff member’s duty station to the spouse’s officially recognized place of Home Leave and back to the duty station; travel from the UNDP staff member’s duty station to the place where Home Leave is exercised and back to the duty station; Travel from the spouse’s duty station to the UNDP staff member’s officially recognized place of Home Leave and back. A UNDP staff member accompanying a spouse will be granted travel time appropriate to the travel involved. The UNDP staff member will be deducted the required 24 points when taking HL as an accompanying spouse.  The frequency of Home Leave travel may not exceed the established periodicity of the HL travel under UNDP.  Official business while on home leave The purpose of annual leave and Home Leave is to allow the staff member to take time off from work for personal/family reasons, and for purposes of health and rest. Official business while on Home Leave should therefore be discouraged. If official business is undertaken during Home Leave travel, the requirement for length of stay in the home country may be adjusted.  However, if staff members are required to carry out official business while on Home Leave outside their duty station, they will normally be entitled to DSA as follows:  If official business is at the officially recognized place of Home Leave: 50 per cent of the applicable DSA rate, if hotel accommodation is not required; and 100 per cent of the applicable DSA rate, on provision of receipted hotel bills in cases when accommodation was required. If official business is at a place beyond commuting distance from the officially recognized Home Leave place: 100 per cent of the applicable rate.    Separation from service  Staff members who are separated from service without completing the required six months of service following the date of return from Home Leave, will not receive payment of repatriation travel expenses for themselves or their dependents. The staff member will, however, receive payment of repatriation unaccompanied shipment or relocation grant. In such cases, Home Leave will be considered as the repatriation travel and the staff member will be informed of this change in entitlement in writing. Travel time on Home Leave  For travel on both the outward and the return journey on Home Leave travel, staff members who opt for the lump sum payment shall be granted a fixed amount of travel time not chargeable to annual leave determined on the basis of the most direct flight from the duty station to the place of Home Leave, as follows:  One day for each journey of less than 10 hours;  Two days for each journey of 10 hours or longer but less than 16 hours;     Three days for each journey of 16 hours or more.   When the staff member opts for the travel lump sum, travel time shall be applied to working days regardless of when travel actual took place.  No compensation in terms of travel time applies for travel undertaken on a weekend or official holiday when travel is arranged by the Organization. Proof of Travel Upon return from home leave travel, a staff member is required to upload supporting documents into eServices to provide evidence of compliance with the required minimum length of stay in the home country and that travel took place as authorized.  Such evidence may include but is not limited to:   Used airline tickets and boarding passes, in hard copy or electronic form; or national passport containing the dates of arrival and departure from the country to which a particular home leave travel was authorized.  If travelling by car, proof of travel will be any evidence showing that travel took place, such as stamped passports and receipts of payments for road tolls, fuel etc. Failure to upload documentary evidence and/or travel deviations that are not in line with the authorized entitlement, may result in recovery of the home leave lump sum or recovery of the cost of the air tickets if the home leave travel was arranged by the organization.  Appendix D to the UN Staff Rules Appendix D to the UN Staff Rules establishes the rules governing compensation in the event of death, injury or illness attributable to the performance of official duties.  Therefore, under the provisions of Appendix D to the UN Staff Rules, a staff member is covered for travel on HL by means of transportation furnished by or at the expense or direction of UNDP, including travel by automobile specifically authorized in advance, and not for the personal convenience of the staff member. Deviation from authorized travel route  A staff member who deviates from the authorized travel route for personal convenience is not covered by UNDP’s liability during the legs of the journey which correspond to the deviation from the authorized route.  Stopovers  UNDP’s liability covers only authorized stopovers for the authorized duration and waiting periods for connecting carriers.  If the staff member chooses to stay for a longer period for personal convenience, UNDP ceases to have any liability beyond the authorized period of that stopover. Using privately-owned vehicles  The provisions of Appendix D do not apply for privately-owned vehicle transportation sanctioned or authorized by UNDP solely at the request of, or for the convenience of the staff member.   ",
    "hours-work": "Hours of Work    Work Week     1.   The organizations of the Common System have agreed to establish a common workweek among their representations at the same duty station. A common workweek is to be understood as a similar (equal) length of the workweek — i.e. the number of scheduled hours of work in a week — among United Nations system organizations at a duty station. The actual scheduling of working hours may vary from organization to organization, usually following the pattern of their counterparts in the government. The common workweek has the advantage of encouraging equity among United Nations system staff at the duty station.    Official Hours of Work    Working hours    In duty stations outside New York, the UNDP Resident Representative (RR) or Head of Office establishes the normal official working hours in consultation with the other UN system agencies’ representatives and members of the Local Salary Survey Committee (LSSC), and taking into consideration local government working hours and prevailing practices.     In New York, the normal working hours are from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm, Monday through Friday, with a break of one hour for lunch. During the period when the General Assembly is in session (1 October to 31 December), the working hours are from 9:30 am to 6:00 pm.    Staff members are required to work during the hours set by the RR or Head of Office, unless they are working under a flexitime or part-time arrangement. Exceptions may be made by the RR or Head of Office as required.     Working hours for each UNDP office are normally between 35 and 40 hours per week. For certain categories of staff, the normal workweek may be longer, in compliance with prevailing practices of the best local employers as established in the local salary scale.    Lunch break    6.   In accordance with International Labour Organization (ILO) practices, all staff members, except those working on a part-time basis, must take a minimum 30-minute lunch break during the regular workday.    Official Holidays   The organizations of the Common System have 10 official holidays annually, including those official holidays mandated by the General Assembly, which shall be observed at all duty stations.     The official holidays not mandated by the General Assembly are designated by the Secretary-General at Headquarters, and by the RR or Head of Office, in consultation with the agency representatives at the same duty station. These holidays are applicable to all Common System organizations in the duty station.   If any official holiday occurs on a non-scheduled workday, either the preceding or the following day is considered an official holiday.     Designated Holidays    10. The General Assembly in March 1998 decided to increase the number of official holidays from nine to ten each year, to observe the two holidays of Eid Al-Fitr and Eid Al-Adha. As a result, staff members at all duty stations are to observe the two holidays of Eid Al-Fitr and Eid Al-Adha. The remaining eight official holidays should be decided on at each duty station, after consultation with UN Common System organizations and staff (see paragraph 11 below).     Offices outside New York    11. In offices outside New York, eight of the ten official holidays are designated annually by the UNDP RR or Head of Office, following consultation with the other UN agency representatives at the same duty station.     New York Office Holiday Schedule    The 10 official holidays in NY are the following:  New Year’s Day (1 January);  President’s Birthday (third Monday in February);  Good Friday (Friday preceding Easter Sunday);  Eid Al-Fitr;  Eid Al-Adha;  Memorial Day (last Monday in May);  Independence Day (4 July);  Labour Day (first Monday in September);  Thanksgiving Day (fourth Thursday in November); and   Christmas Day (25 December).    If one of the above days occurs on a Saturday or Sunday, the preceding Friday is considered an official holiday in lieu of Saturday and the following Monday in lieu of Sunday.     If a holiday falls during a period of annual or sick leave, the staff member will receive credit for that day — i.e. the holiday will be recorded as a holiday and not a sick or vacation day.  National, Local and Religious Holidays    15.  Absence from work on any national, local or religious holiday is charged to annual leave, unless that day is one of the 10 official UNDP holidays at the duty station concerned (see paragraph 11 above).    Holiday Credit during Special Leave    16.  If a holiday falls during a period of special leave — for example,  maternity leave or special leave without pay — the staff member does not receive credit for that day (i.e. the holiday is included as part of the period of special leave).

    "interim-roster-rules-procedure": " UNDP Interim Roster Rules of Procedure  Rationale  BMS/OHR, in cooperation with BMS/ITM, is developing a new comprehensive recruitment system, E-recruit. This new system will facilitate the recruitment process at many different stages, such as screening, interview, CRB and the establishment of various rosters. Until this new system is fully operational, a provisional solution with the Interim Rosters Platform in Quantum is being offered.   Since the launch of the Compliance Review Board (CRB) in July 2009, a pool of approximately 700 alternate candidates with expertise in various practice areas, have been brought to and endorsed by the CRB. These candidates in most cases are those that are recommended by the interview panel and endorsed by the CRB for selection in case the primary candidate is not available. This information is now being systematically made available to HR practitioners in the Interim Roster module in Quantum. Composition  The Interim rosters consist of internal and external alternate candidates for International Professionals Fixed Term Appointments (FTA) from P2-D1 that have been endorsed by the CRB. This group of personnel is the base for the interim roster. In addition, the roster includes staff returning from Secondment and other staff ready for immediate placement.  Candidate Search The search capabilities of the Interim Rosters Platform in Quantum allow the HR practitioner in the hiring unit to identify endorsed alternate candidates for a similar post than the one wishing to be filled. The data can be sorted by grade level and job title including functional area.   Before contacting the candidates in the roster, the hiring unit in consultation of the OHR Business Partner in OHR/BMS, should determine if the position to be filled is similar to the ones in the rosters. To do so, the hiring unit may request the job description by sending a request via their OHR Business Partner. A job description is determined to be similar if it fulfills the following criteria:   Same Grade Same Quantum title All but one same function  Similar functional competencies and Similar educational requirement Information Request and Vacancy Announcement The hiring unit may request information about a candidate(s) in a roster before or after a vacancy has been announced. After the hiring unit has ensured that the vacancy matches one of the positions in the rosters, it may request further information such as the CV, interview report minutes, and reference checks of the candidates endorsed for the matched position. A request form signed by the Head of Office or his designated official should be submitted to the OHR Business partner. This information should be treated as confidential.  The Vacancy Announcement would need to be published internally for a minimum of one week to allow for internal candidates to apply. The rationale behind this requirement is that at the time of the advertisement of the original position, UNDP had not disclosed that applicants were going to be retained for a roster. Therefore, due process must be followed to allow internal candidates to apply.  The status of candidates that fit the pre-determined requirements of a post, and are under consideration will have to be marked as “Pipelined”. Candidates will retain this status for 30 days to allow the candidate to be assessed by the hiring unit. After this period either become automatically “Available” for consideration by other hiring units or be marked as “Selected” by the hiring unit as applicable.  Assessment and Selection  If qualified internal candidates apply for the position, the hiring unit must conduct all the assessment methodologies such as Competency Based Interview, technical test, psychometrics test or any additional testing, as stipulated in the Hiring Unit Recruitment Strategy for both the applicants through the internal vacancy announcement as well as the candidates from the roster.   When as a result of the one week internal advertisement, no internal candidate meets the minimum eligibility criteria to be placed in the short-list; the hiring unit may proceed with the assessment of the candidate(s) from the Interim Roster. The hiring manager may conduct a streamlined assessment in the form of desk review and face to face interview/videoconference, with the presence of an HR representative, in lieu of a Competency Based Interview. Priority Considerations and Roster Tiers In full compliance with Section 4.0 of the revised Recruitment and Selection Framework covering corporate priorities, full regard to UNDP internal candidates, order of retention in cases of abolition of post or reduction of staff, and diversity provisions, candidates that fit the pre-defined requirements for a post as per the job description will be shown and should be given full consideration in the following order:  Internal:   Staff members ready for immediate placement Staff returning from secondment or loan Staff members holding a Permanent Appointment (PA) and Fixed Term Appointment (FTA)   External:   Staff members  holding a Temporary Appointment (TA) or a PA or FTA of entities in the UN Common system Any other external candidate  Record of Selection Recommendation and Accountability The hiring unit must document the process leading to the selection recommendation and submit their case for endorsement either to the CRB or the Director of OHR as applicable:  If as a result of the internal advertisement, the selected primary or alternate candidate’s grade is at a lower level than the post being advertised, or is a UNDP staff member holding an FTA whose initial appointments on 200-series Staff Rules was not reviewed by the Appointment (and Promotion) Board (APB/AB), the hiring unit must present the case to the CRB for endorsement along with all the necessary documentation as per the current CRB ToRs.   If the selected primary or alternate is a candidate from the roster, the hiring unit does not need to present it to the CRB for endorsement. Instead, the hiring unit will have to present the case to the Director of OHR by filling out the appropriate forms and attaching all the relevant supporting documentation including the considerations given to internal candidates. The following documents should accompany the submission (Please send an electronic copy to the respective OHR Business partner.:  Interim Roster Submission Form  Detailed Jobsite Long/Short list report   Desk Review and Interview Minutes   Candidates whose selection would entail a lateral move must be presented for the approval of the Director of OHR/BMS by submitting the Reassignment through Competitive Process form as per the current procedures.

On the other, the IPSA will at the same time provide for attractive, stable and fair conditions of employment which ensure that UNDP is able to attract, select and retain the services of high-quality individuals.  Individuals engaged under the IPSA framework have the status of International Personnel Service Agreement holders, and are specifically engaged in recognition of their skills and expertise, to provide identified deliverables. These individuals are not UNDP staff members, but are considered affiliate personnel and, as such are not governed by or subject to the United Nations’ Staff Regulations and Rules. Nor is this contract modality governed by national legislation in countries where UNDP operates. Given that the services covered by the IPSA may only be provided by natural and not legal persons (e.g., duly formed/registered companies), and by non-incorporated partnerships, the IPSA falls within the overall scope of UNDP Human Resource management framework.  The IPSA may also be used by UNDP to contract individuals on behalf of entities to which it may provide such services (“partners”), whereby the personnel so contracted are supervised by such partners. Such contracts are administered by UNDP. This facility is provided for in the related policy on Partner Personnel Service Agreement (“PPSA”).  The IPSA is governed solely by its expressed terms and conditions, including the Terms of Reference (“TOR”).  Applicability  The following policy shall apply to International Personnel Services Agreements concluded by UNDP to perform services for UNDP.  UNV and UNCDF can hire IPSAs in accordance with this Policy under the same conditions applicable to UNDP.   An IPSA holder is normally a person engaged to perform specialist functions in a country other than their home country or place of permanent residence. In programme countries, the National Personal Services Agreement (NPSA) should be used. However, IPSA holders may undertake an assignment in their home country provided they have multi-country responsibilities as per the terms of reference and is expected to travel on official business outside the home country for more than one-third of the service period, such cases should be cleared by BMS/OHR.  Use of IPSA   There are functions that have an international element to them, where specific technical expertise is not available at that required level locally, where local challenges and conflicts may require a neutral approach, or where the independent role of UNDP is required. In such instances, an International PSA position should be established as opposed to a national PSA position.   When should the IPSA be used:  The IPSA is to be used when engaging individuals in any of the following circumstances:  When undertaking the performance of specific task(s) or delivery of work for the implementation of project(s) or other activities of a business unit which is funded by a project (or projects) or a non-continuous source of funding, and required for a defined period of time (for example, for the duration of the active project(s) carried out by UNDP or its funding);  When undertaking the performance of specific task(s) that is/are needed because of the variable business volume due to the nature of UNDP’s business model;  When the services require specialized technical, peculiar or unique skills, that are not part of UNDP’s staff capability or may not be needed long-term by UNDP;  The IPSA may not be used in the following cases:  When the functions are of both, inherent and continuous in nature (as defined in Annex 3).  To re-instate a staff member whose previous post/function of identical nature has been abolished.  As a means of applying a probationary period to candidates prior to offering them a staff appointment.  Where the services required based on specific deliverables and payments are lump-sum based. In such cases, the Individual Contract (IC) modality of UNDP should be used, governed by its own set of procurement guidelines. Automatic conversions from IC to IPSA are not possible given that the two modalities follow two very different purposes and assessments, except during the transition period indicated above.  Legal Status of the IPSA holder  A holder of an IPSA is known as an IPSA holder and is engaged pursuant to the express terms and conditions of the IPSA. IPSA holders are not recruited under United Nations Staff Regulations and Rules and UNDP business units must ensure that the treatment of IPSAs is consistent with the IPSA Policy, their IPSA and their status.  IPSA holders have the legal status of a contractor vis-à-vis UNDP, and are not staff members of UNDP or any other entity of the United Nations (“UN”) under the Staff Regulations and Rules of the UN, or “officials” of UNDP or any other entity of the UN for the purposes of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, adopted by the General Assembly of the UN on 13 February 1946 (“General Convention”).  IPSA holders may have the status of “expert on mission for the United Nations” under Section 22, Article VI, of the General Convention, and may perform official duties for the United Nations. Whether or not an IPSA holder can be recognized as an expert within the framework of the General Convention is an issue that, if the need arises, will be conclusively determined by the Secretary-General of the United Nations or his/her delegate, the UN Legal Counsel, through the Legal Office of UNDP.  IPSA holders have no authority or any other right to incur any legal or financial obligations on behalf of UNDP. The IPSA holder may not expressly or implicitly represent to any person authority that the IPSA holder does not have.  General Rights and Obligations of the IPSA holders  Rights and obligations under the IPSA are strictly limited to its express terms and conditions.  A. General rights and obligations  The terms and conditions of the IPSA differ from the terms and conditions applicable to UNDP staff members appointed under the UN Staff Regulations and Rules. IPSA holders are excluded from participation in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund and After-Service Health Insurance. Further, IPSA holders shall not be entitled to any additional benefit, payment, subsidy, compensation or entitlement, except those expressly stated in the IPSA.  IPSA holders may neither seek nor accept any instructions in connection with UNDP from any authority external to UNDP. Should any authority external to UNDP seek to impose any instructions on IPSA holders in connection with UNDP, they must promptly notify UNDP and provide all reasonable assistance required by UNDP to address this matter. An IPSA holder must not take any action that may adversely affect the interests of UNDP and must perform their obligations under the IPSA with the fullest regard to the interests of UNDP. During the period of service with UNDP, an IPSA holder must refrain from any conduct that would reflect adversely on UNDP or the rest of the UN system (or both), and must not engage in any activity that is incompatible with their performance of services for UNDP under the IPSA.  UNDP may arrange for the issuance of a ticket or payment of a lump sum to allow the IPSA holder to reach their duty station of assignment.  The class of travel will be economy class, and no daily subsistence allowance (DSA) is paid for the assignment travel.  During the term of the IPSA and even after the expiration or termination of an IPSA, IPSA holders must assist UNDP in any disputes with third parties, and cooperate with audits conducted by the Office of Audit and Investigations or the Board of Auditors and/or investigations relating to matters on which the IPSA holders worked or have knowledge. Such assistance may include providing UNDP or its lawyers (or both) with information regarding an IPSA holder’s service under the IPSA, and serving as a witness in arbitration, conciliation, mediation and/or similar proceedings. Whether or not UNDP exercises such an option, an IPSA holder may not voluntarily or at the request of a third party, without being compelled to do so by relevant authorities, provide any assistance (other than serving, subject to the provisions of the IPSA regarding confidentiality, as an unremunerated fact witness) to the other party or parties to the dispute without the prior written consent of, or in the case of a request of relevant authorities, without notifying, UNDP.  B. Professional Liability  IPSA holders are solely liable for claims by third parties arising from their own negligence and/or intentional acts or omissions committed during the course of the IPSA and must ensure that under no circumstances will UNDP be held liable for such claims.  All IPSA holders must obtain professional liability insurance when requested by UNDP. In such cases, proof of purchase and maintenance of the professional liability insurance must be provided to UNDP upon request.  IPSA holders must indemnify UNDP and its officials, agents, employees and contractors from and against all suits, proceedings, claims, demands, losses and liabilities of any kind or nature, including, but not limited to, all litigation costs and expenses, attorney fees, settlement payments and damages, based on, arising from, or relating to:  Allegations or claims that the use by UNDP of any device, any material or any other goods or services provided by the IPSA holder, in whole or in part, separately or in combination, constitutes an infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right of any third party; and  Allegations or claims that the IPSA holder during the term of the IPSA caused injury, loss or damage, whether physical, psychological and/or financial, to anyone who is not a party to the IPSA, including, without limitation, allegations and claims in the nature of a claim for workers’ compensation.  C. Compliance and working arrangements  IPSA holders must comply with all legislation, ordinances, rules, regulations, instruments, and other applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions (e.g., country of origin, country of residence, country(ies) where services are performed), including but not limited to those relating to taxation, licenses, work permits and visas. Under no circumstances will UNDP be responsible for paying or reimbursing such taxes. IPSA holders must provide periodic proof of payment of taxes when requested to provide such proof by UNDP.  IPSA holders are responsible for and must arrange for any necessary visa(s) and/or work permit(s) prior to starting the IPSA, and UNDP will provide support for the applicant’s visa request. All costs related to visas and work permits, if any, are to be fully borne by the IPSA holder. UNDP will not reimburse IPSA holders for visa and/or work permit fees unless the IPSA holder is (subsequent to arrival in the duty station to commence assignment) requested to undertake travel to other locations for UNDP, in which case any visa and/or work permit fees necessary for other locations may be claimed through submission of a travel/expense claim and supporting documents.  IPSA holders may serve on corporate committees (such as interview panels, contracts and property committee, vendor review committee, etc.), however, IPSA holders may not serve as chair, alternate chair or be the majority voting members on corporate committees.  Standards of Conduct  IPSA holders must comply with the standards of conduct set forth in the UN Secretary General’s Bulletin of 9 October 2003 entitled “Special Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse” (ST/SGB/2003/13) and the UN Secretary-General’s Bulletin of 18 June 2002 entitled “Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission” (ST/SGB/2002/9) as they may be amended from time to time. Furthermore, IPSA holders must comply with all applicable UNDP administrative issuances.  In the performance of services under the IPSA, IPSA holders must comply with the standards of conduct set in the Secretary General’s Bulletin ST/SGB/2002/9 of 18 June 2002, entitled “Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Expert on Mission”. IPSA holders must comply with all security directives issued by UNDP.   Although IPSA holders do not have the status of a United Nations official/staff member, while working on UNDP-related activities, they must comply with the standards of conduct required of a UN civil servant except to the extent such standards are, in the opinion of UNDP, inherently inconsistent with their status as an IPSA holder.  Any breach of the IPSA will be grounds for immediate termination for cause, at the sole discretion of UNDP. If the IPSA holder is found by UNDP to have engaged in fraudulent or similar conduct, UNDP may refer the matter to the relevant national authorities.  IPSA holders must cooperate fully and in good faith with any investigation conducted in accordance with UNDP’s Legal Framework for Addressing Non-compliance with United Nations Standards of Conduct” as well as any audit conducted by, or on behalf of, the Office of Audit and Investigations of UNDP or the UN Board of Auditors.  IPSA holders are bound by the terms of their IPSA to respect the impartiality and independence of the United Nations and UNDP and to exercise the utmost discretion in all matters relating to the performance of their assignment. During the period of service with UNDP, IPSA holders may not engage in any activity that is incompatible with the discharge of their duties with the organization. They should exercise utmost discretion in all matters of official activities of the organization.  Unless specifically set out in their IPSA and/or authorized in writing by the UNDP Administrator or his/her designate, IPSA holders should not communicate at any time to the media, or to any institution, person, government, or other external entity/authority any information that has not been made public and which has become known to them by reason of their association with UNDP, nor should they use such information for private advantage. These obligations will survive the expiration or termination of the IPSA.  An individual on IPSA may not engage in an outside professional activity (i.e. not for UNDP) whether remunerated or not, unless and only if the individual has received prior approval of UNDP to do so from the Head of the Business Unit.    Title Rights   UNDP will be entitled to all intellectual property and other proprietary rights, including, but not limited to, patents, copyrights and trademarks, with regard to products, processes, inventions, ideas, know-how or documents and other materials which the IPSA holder has developed for UNDP under the IPSA and which bear a direct relation to or are produced or prepared or collected in consequence of, or during the course of, the performance of the IPSA. The IPSA holder must acknowledge and agree that such products, documents and other materials constitute works made for hire for UNDP in the IPSA. However, to the extent that any such intellectual property or other proprietary rights consist of any intellectual property or other proprietary rights of the IPSA holder: (a) that pre-existed the performance by the IPSA holder of his/her obligations under the IPSA, or (b) that the IPSA holder may develop or acquire, or may have developed or acquired, independently of the performance of their obligations under the IPSA, UNDP does not and will not claim any ownership interest thereto, and the IPSA holder must grant to UNDP a perpetual license to use such intellectual property or other proprietary right solely for the purposes of and in accordance with the requirements of the IPSA. At the request of UNDP, the IPSA holder must take all necessary steps, execute all necessary documents and generally assist in securing such proprietary rights and transferring or licensing them to UNDP in compliance with the requirements of the applicable law and of the IPSA. Subject to the foregoing provisions, all maps, drawings, photographs, plans, reports, estimates, recommendations, documents and all data compiled by or received by the IPSA holder under the IPSA will be the property of UNDP, must be made available for use or inspection by UNDP, must be treated as confidential and must be delivered only to UNDP authorized officials on completion of work under the IPSA.  Nature of relationship between UNDP and the IPSA holder  An IPSA holder is not and may not represent himself or herself as being an agent of UNDP. The IPSA holder shall be solely responsible for all claims arising out of or relating to its actions or omissions.  Any disputes between the IPSA holder and UNDP will be subject to the dispute resolution mechanism in the IPSA.  Duration of an IPSA  An IPSA may be issued for up to 12 months at a time, and may be renewed for up to 4 years, however, not to exceed the maximum duration of the project. The maximum period for the use of an IPSA is normally for the duration of the project and/or its expected funding period. Should an IPSA be required beyond the four years under similar terms of reference and within the same project, a review of the function must be conducted and documented to reconfirm that the conditions of use of IPSA have not changed which would then reset the period for another four years. This cycle may be repeated as many times as may be needed, provided the functions performed continue to be under the conditions of when a PSA may be used.  Due to its nature and purpose, the duration of the agreement has implications on the benefits and entitlements package of each agreement category. While regular IPSAs are expected to be of at least 6 months in duration and provide for the set of benefits and entitlements, other agreement categories under the IPSA such as the retainer agreement will not have these benefits.  Subject to the provisions of this policy, an IPSA may be extended on an annual basis if the IPSA holder has performed satisfactorily and continues working with the identical TOR.  The IPSA carries no expectation of any future or other engagement with UNDP.  There may be specific instances where the need and intention are to issue a regular IPSA, but the current approved-budget periods are shorter than the minimum permissible duration of six months. In order to allow individuals to benefit from the Regular IPSA package and to facilitate the operational needs of the office, the policy provides the following options to the hiring units, provided the budget is expected to be extended beyond that:  Issue a Regular IPSA for a duration of less than six months noting the intention and the budget expectations, or  Issue a Regular IPSA for a duration of six months or more, with the expectation to foreshorten the IPSA should the budget not be sufficiently approved at the later stage (expectations are for both UNDP and the IPSA holder, including the potential bearing of the termination indemnity by the hiring unit).    Functions: Specialist Functions     An IPSA holder is an individual engaged by UNDP for a defined period of time, in the framework of the awarded IPSA, to provide Specialist services such as expert advisory services, technical skills and/or knowledge services. Specialist services are typically performed by a recognized specialist or authority in a specific field and the services performed are mainly of an intellectual and varied character. Performance of specialist services involves the regular and consistent exercise of discretion and judgment and the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be standardized in relation to a given period of time.   An IPSA holder may supervise the technical functions of, and/or provide inputs to the performance evaluation of a staff member if the staff member’s terms of reference are of technical nature, as may be determined by the Head of the Business Unit, or his/her delegate.  Types of IPSAs: Regular and Retainer Agreements; Office- and Home-based    The IPSA agreement may not take the form of a lump sum agreement. In this case, an Individual Contract should be awarded within the framework of the applicable procurement process.  The below is a summary of the types of IPSA engagements depending on the needs of the business unit:     IPSA agreements other than retainer or short-term agreements are referred to as “Regular” agreements. Regular IPSAs are to be used when services are required on a more continuous basis throughout the project periods. Payments are made at the end of each calendar month.  IPSA agreements may be issued as a retainer which is considered a short-term agreement. A retainer agreement is issued for a period of time during which the services of the IPSA holder are required intermittently. The IPSA agreement on a retainer basis will specify a “unit price” (e.g. amount per hour, amount per translated page, etc.). For budgetary purposes, a monetary cap will be determined when the agreement is issued. Retainers may also be used for immediate assignments, for example, in response to project proposals within very specific timeframes, and is issued based on an extended time span rather than intermittently.  Additionally, any of the IPSA modalities may be used to engage someone on a home-based IPSA when they are not expected to work in any UNDP office or work location, or work is expected to be done on an intermittent basis only (i.e. the IPSA holder will mainly work away from a UNDP work location). The home-based status may also be applied to regular IPSAs with a daily or monthly remuneration and to IPSAs issued as retainer agreements, depending on the exigencies of the hiring business unit.  Engagement of Former and Retired UN Staff Members, and other Non-Staff Personnel   In the selection and engagement of IPSA holders, it is important to note that the engagement of candidates that currently work or have previously worked as UN staff members, or are retired UN staff members, is subject to special rules.  Staff members may not be separated for the sole purpose of immediately re-engaging them on an IPSA. Should the staff member wish to convert to an IPSA, and submits a motivated request in writing, UNDP may consider any such requests provided that it is compatible with the relevant terms of reference as well as the position structure and requirements. The Head of the Business Unit may make the determination on the functions, however, any such conversion must only be made in full consultation with the Legal Office. In such cases, a one-month break in service must occur between separation from the existing staff contract (Permanent Contract /Fixed-Term Appointment/) and the commencement of the IPSA.  A United Nations staff member who has separated may only enter into an IPSA with an effective starting date at least one (1) month after the effective separation date.     Former staff and non-staff personnel may be recruited only after the expiration of such other contract. In no case may such other contract be foreshortened in order to allow such person to be engaged under an IPSA.  Determining remuneration of Former or Retired Staff Members:   When a former staff member is engaged on an IPSA, the remuneration must not be based on the level of remuneration before separation but rather on the nature and complexity of the assignment to be performed under the IPSA.   Engagement of former Staff Members in receipt of a UN Pension:   Former staff members in receipt of a UN pension benefit, may be engaged under IPSA only if:   The engagement represents both a cost-effective and a compliant solution to meet the service needs of the hiring business unit; A competitive process was carried out and is properly documented;  The 30-day break in service requirement is met (not applicable to temporary appointments); The former staff member in receipt of a UN pension benefit was not separated on grounds of disciplinary action or unsatisfactory performance; and The individual is medically certified as fit.  The Head of the Business Unit (as the term is defined below) must ensure that the remuneration of a UNDP (or UN and its funds and programmes) retiree does not exceed the limits set for those receiving a UNJSPF pension benefit.  Engagements of former staff in receipt of a UNJSPF pension benefit must not exceed the total duration of 6 months, or total UN derived remuneration of USD 50,000 within one calendar year, whichever comes first, and are non-renewable within one calendar year.   Engaging Close Relatives of UNDP Personnel     IPSA holders are subject to UNDP’s policy on Family Relationships.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Head of the Business Unit must at all times ensure adherence to the requirements in the Staff Regulations and Rules relating to conflict of interest (refer to Staff Regulations and Rules 1.2 g m). If in doubt, the Ethics Office should be consulted for support.  Authority for the Issuance of IPSA     The authority to create any IPSA position classified as up to and including the IPSA 11 category, as well as the decision to award such an agreement to the selected individual, is delegated to the Resident Representative in Country Offices, and to the Bureau Director or his/her Deputy for non-country office duty stations (HQ, liaison offices, RSCs, policy centers, etc.), as well as UNV/UNCDF Executive Coordinator, and UNOSSC Director, or his/her deputy.  The authority to create positions and issue any IPSA classified IPSA 12 or above is delegated to the Bureau Director or his/her Deputy, as well as UNV/UNCDF Executive Coordinator, and UNOSSC Director, or his/her Deputy through the Regional HR Business Partners, for the business unit seeking such a position.                         Responsibility and Accountability  IPSA holders like all other UNDP personnel are accountable to the Administrator for the regularity of actions undertaken by them in the course of official duties. IPSA holders involved in any action that is contrary to the Financial Regulations and Rules, or to organizational policies, or other prescriptive guidance (i.e., the POPP) may be held personally responsible and financially liable for the consequences arising therefrom.    Responsibility for the correct and effective application and proper management of the IPSA policy and procedures, as well as the creation, issuance and management of individual IPSAs, is distributed to various roles in the organization, subject to oversight by BMS/OHR. Responsibilities and roles are described in Section XXXIV (34) in this policy.    UNDP, as the steward and utilization of public funds in its operations and administration, must use due care to ensure funds are utilized only for their intended purpose. Individuals holding a Delegation of Authority must be particularly careful to ensure actions undertaken by themselves or persons under their supervision are in compliance with the Financial Regulations and Rules, Programme and Operations Policies and Procedures (POPP), organizational directives, policies and prescriptive guidance applicable to UNDP.  Persons with delegated authority will be held accountable for the regularity of their actions relating to management of IPSAs in their respective business unit.  Classification & Established Scales   The IPSA (Regular and Short-term) consists of a number of levels at which IPSA holders are recruited. The levels are established with broad reference to the International Professional grades and correspond to them in terms of methodology of classification. All IPSA Terms of Reference use UNDP’s competency framework, and positions are classified using standards and frames of reference used within the UN system.    The following levels and classifications scale are established:   IPSA8 (equivalent to P1) IPSA9 (equivalent to P2) IPSA10 (equivalent to P3) IPSA11 (equivalent to P4) IPSA12 (equivalent to P5) IPSA13 (equivalent to D1) IPSA14 (equivalent to D2)*  * Specific senior technical roles, not for functions of a representative or authoritative nature  Selection of IPSAs  UNDP Offices must comply with the principles of UNDP’s recruitment and selection framework, which include transparency and competitive selection, regardless of contract modality.  The different modalities for the selection of IPSAs are outlined in Annex 1 to this policy.  For regular IPSAs the modalities include: Competitive, via a Vacancy Announcement (VA); Using a candidate that has been pre-assessed in a previous competitive process at the same grade level, in the last 36 months; Direct selection from an HR or other approved Roster;  Lateral move from another IPSA position to a substantially similar role at the same level; and Direct selection upon approval of the  Bureau Director.  In addition to the modalities listed in i), for short-term IPSAs, the modalities include: Direct selection from a procurement roster, i.e., GPN; Direct selection of an individual serving as an IC holder in 2021 or thereafter; and Review and assessment of candidate CVs/P11s.  For competitive recruitment processes, one or more assessment methods must be used. These can include, among others, panel interviews, tests, desk reviews, technical assessments.  Medical Clearance    Individuals are responsible to ensure that their medical state is suitable and adequate to perform the functions they have applied for or have agreed to perform.  A medical certificate from a physician certifying the mental and physical health of the individual is suitable for the performance of the duties and responsibilities, as well as the working environment in terms of location, are required, and should be submitted by the individual prior to any contractual engagement. The cost of the medical examination should be charged to the same source of funding as the IPSA itself, and the medical certification should be placed in the relevant file of the IPSA holder.  IPSA holders may be required, at any time, to undergo a medical examination when requested to do so to protect their health and safety, to follow-up on chronic health conditions, or to assess how a change in health circumstances since a prior certification might affect an IPSA holder’s capability to fulfill the functions for which they were contracted.  Part-time work  The hiring business unit may deem that the functions and activities appropriate for the IPSA modality may be performed on a part-time basis. The basic principle for establishing the pay for part-time remuneration is that of pro-rating the pay from full-time pay for comparable work. For example, if an IPSA holder is engaged to work a four-day week (with normal working hours) the pay would be set at 80% of the pay for an IPSA with the same terms of reference on a full-time basis. Similarly, any other elements in the pay package (e.g. the organization’s portion of the subsidy for health insurance; group life and disability insurance etc. will be 80%) are to be pro-rated in the same manner.  The precise working arrangements of the part-time work must be clearly specified in the agreement and understood by the IPSA holder and the immediate supervisor. Any change to the hours of work and pay must be made by an amendment to the agreement.  IPSA Extension, Expiration and Termination:  IPSA Extension (Regular IPSAs)  If a decision is taken to extend an IPSA, it is an opportunity to discuss and review the terms of reference, and whether any modifications are needed, bearing in mind that significant modification may require a new agreement altogether. Changes of more than two main functions are considered significant modifications and require a new hiring process.  An IPSA can be renewed for periods up to one year at a time, in line with fund availability and suitability of performance.    Expiration of IPSAs  IPSAs carry no expectation of renewal beyond its expiration date. Should the supervisor wish to extend the IPSA beyond its expiration date, a request for extension should be made, following communication with the IPSA holder and as early as possible before the expiration date of the IPSA.  In the event that a regular IPSA is not renewed, the supervisor must inform the operational units (HR/Finance/IT) to ensure that necessary actions are taken, e.g. recovery of any indebtedness to the organization, return of UNDP property such as computers/laptops, building access ID cards, keys, badges, etc. and release of final pay.   The UNDP Office may provide a letter of service upon request.  Termination of Agreement & Termination indemnity  Either party may terminate the IPSA before the expiry date of the agreement by giving a minimum period of 30 calendar days’ notice in writing to the other party (IPSA holder and Hiring Manager).  BMS/OLS must be consulted prior to the termination of an IPSA by UNDP, unless the separation is mutually agreed to in writing by both the IPSA holder and the UNDP Office involved.  In the event that the IPSA is foreshortened by UNDP without cause (i.e., through no fault of the IPSA holder), an IPSA holder is entitled to a termination indemnity equivalent to one month of net pay.  If UNDP terminates the IPSA for cause (i.e., as a result of violation of the standards of conduct or breach of other material terms of the IPSA), the IPSA holder will not be entitled to either a period of notice or other compensation, and will not be eligible for any future contract of engagement of any type.   No compensation or termination indemnity payment shall be made in the event that the IPSA holder terminates the IPSA, or upon its natural expiration.  The Head of the Business Unit must terminate the IPSA in the following circumstances:  Abandonment of functions, i.e., when the IPSA holder is absent from duty without approval for more than five consecutive days;  Violation of the standards of conduct or other material terms of the IPSA, including, but not limited to, acts of fraud or misrepresentation;  In event of unsatisfactory performance, where the Head of the Business Unit should consult with BMS/OHR and BMS/OLS before deciding whether to terminate the agreement.  There is zero tolerance for acts of fraud and violations of the standards of conduct, and any such suspicions must be referred to OAI for review, and if the IPSA holder is found to have engaged in these acts, the Business Unit after consultation with the Legal Office, is expected to terminate the agreement. Advice must be sought from the Legal Office prior to taking any decision on such an action.  Remuneration Scales, Bands, and Remuneration setting for IPSAs  The remuneration scale for IPSAs will be set globally by the Director of BMS.  The IPSA comprises a number of levels at which IPSA holders can be appointed. The classification of these levels is aligned to the corresponding UNDP grade levels and is set out in the form of broad bands, as shown in the table below. They provide a necessary degree of flexibility for hiring managers to adjust the pay according to skills and market circumstances.  The pay of IPSAs will be set at a point between the minimum and the maximum within each band (the range), and the classified level of the position would serve as an indicator for the level of remuneration for individual IPSAs. The lower of the two levels should normally be set anywhere between the minimum and mid-point of the band, and the higher of the two levels around the mid-point.  The Bands:     IPSA holders’ remuneration is set following pay ranges, and the pay is determined by the hiring manager based on contingencies of service including budget, availability of technical expertise in the market, and based on the special skills the individual brings with him/her to the position and to the organization. The remuneration may be anywhere between the minimum and maximum for each band range.  The pay-setting system is provided to assist hiring managers in setting the approximate remuneration range, using the following parameters:   Basic remuneration Cost of living (COL) component Hardship Element in specific duty stations Additional fixed lumpsum to subsidize medical insurance  The basic remuneration represents the basis of the calculation and is relevant to the classified level of the position.  The cost of living component is based on the UN post adjustment as a reference to the applicable post adjustment rate applicable to the duty station where the functions are expected to be performed. The maximum payable COL component is set at 50%. While the UN post adjustment may fluctuate on a monthly basis, it remains static for the duration of the agreement unless it increases or decreases by more than 20% compared to the rate applicable at the start of the IPSA. In this case, the agreement may be amended, and the increase or decrease will be applied from that point onwards and for the remaining period of the agreement. For home-based IPSA holders, the home of the individual is also the duty station.  The hardship element component adds any costs associated with the level of hardship and danger of the duty station.  Base remuneration: Each band comprises a range to allow hiring managers to determine the applicable remuneration depending on budget availability, level of skills of the individual, availability of skills in the market, complexity, qualifications and experience, and any other considerations the hiring manager may have.  Deviations from the above (below the minimum or above the maximum) may be authorized by the Bureau Director or UNV/UNCDF Executive Coordinator, UNOSSC Director, and his/her Deputy or his/her delegated authority.  Cost of Living Component:  The cost of living component represents a mirror of the post adjustment for the duty station of the month of January of each year, and is applied equally for all IPSAs issued throughout that year. The cost of living component is capped and may only reach a maximum of 50%.  It is fixed for the duration of the agreement regardless of fluctuations during the IPSA period. Only in case where the post adjustment changes significantly during the period of the agreement, i.e. more than 20%, the remuneration may be re-calculated and adjusted upwards or downwards.  Hardship Element:  The hardship element consists of a hardship and/or a danger allowance, where applicable. The Hardship Allowance is only applicable in the country where the IPSA holders will perform their functions if this is classified as a duty station D or E. Danger Allowance is applicable in duty stations where Danger Pay is receivable by staff.  A chart with the IPSA pay ranges and how to identify the correct levels, as well as amounts payable under the hardship element is provided in Annex 4 to this policy.  IPSAs are not entitled for Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) in addition to their paid fee while in their duty station.   Currency of Remuneration  The IPSA stipulates a fixed level of remuneration in the currency stated in the agreement, with the default being United States Dollars.  IPSAs may request that their salaries are distributed to up to two bank accounts, regardless of duty station or country.  Remuneration Subject to Taxation  Taxation on remuneration paid to individuals engaged under an IPSA is the sole responsibility of the IPSA holder.  The total remuneration paid to individuals engaged under an IPSA must be specified in gross terms. The remuneration paid to the IPSA holder is not exempt from national or local taxation. UNDP is not responsible for payment of tax on earnings or other taxes due on the remuneration of the IPSA holder, nor is UNDP responsible for reimbursement of taxes paid by IPSA holders in respect of earnings received under IPSA with UNDP. The IPSA holder must provide periodic proof of payment of taxes, and UNDP reserves the right to request proof of payment of taxes by the IPSA holder. Some national governments may exempt IPSA holders from payment of taxes. Such an exemption is solely within the purview of the respective national government and cannot be based on representations by UNDP that IPSA holders are exempt.  The UNDP Office must not be involved in making payroll deductions for the purpose of remitting monies to the national tax authorities, nor is it required to report the earnings of IPSA holders to the tax authorities. The UNDP Office must emphasise to the IPSA holder upon entry on duty that the IPSA holder must be in compliance with their national taxation obligations. This requirement will also be set out in the IPSA template.  Recourse/Settlement of disputes  In the event of any dispute arising out of the IPSA, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the conditions set out in the IPSA on dispute settlement.  Hiring offices/managers should consult and seek the advice of the Legal Office in cases involving issues of breach of agreement, and report to the Office of Audit and Investigations, including cases where misconduct is involved.  IPSA holders can report workplace issues as follows:  Allegations of workplace harassment, sexual harassment and abuse authority, through harassment.support@undp.org; or  Allegations of fraud or mismanagement of UNDP funds, through reportmisconduct@undp.org.  Further details and information can be found under the ‘Accountability’ section on UNDP’s website.  Such allegations must be reported in good faith and with substantiating and detailed information and documentation. Reporting may also be done anonymously, and IPSA holders who work exclusively for UNDP (i.e., not assigned to work for a Partner Agency) are equally protected by UNDP’s Protection against Retaliation Policy.  Overtime     IPSA holders are not entitled to overtime payments or to compensatory time off in lieu if hours performed beyond the regular official working hours.   Hardship and Danger Allowance  Hardship Allowance  In addition to the base monthly remuneration and the cost of living component, IPSA holders who serve in locations classified as D and E are also entitled to a hardship allowance. The hardship allowance is fixed as a lump sum amount specified in Annex 2.  Danger Allowance  An additional component to the Hardship Allowance, and in duty stations where danger pay is receivable by staff, IPSA holders who serve in the same duty station are also entitled to a danger allowance. The Danger Allowance is fixed as a lump sum amount specified in Annex 2.  The Hardship and Danger Allowances are payable based on presence at the duty station. IPSA holders on maternity, paternity, annual or sick leave continue to be eligible as long as they remain in the duty station. The Hardship and Danger Allowances, where applicable, are also payable for time away from the designated duty station on official duty travel up to a maximum of seven consecutive calendar days including weekends and holidays falling during that period. Payment of the Danger Allowance ceases from the eighth day of official duty travel. If the IPSA holder travels on mission to another location that qualifies for Hardship and/or Danger Allowance, they will continue to receive these allowances accordingly.   IPSA Remuneration Advances   IPSA holders may request remuneration advances in emergency situations, provided the project duration, the IPSA duration and the availability of funding cover the amount and the intended period of repayment. In the event that remuneration advances are approved by the supervisor, the same conditions of request and repayment shall apply as for staff  salary advances.   Mandatory subsidized coverage not commutable to cash  The following subsidized coverage is provided by UNDP, and is mandatory to cover possible risks against the individual or the organization. These benefits may not be commuted to cash and are mandatory and applicable as stated below.   Group Life and Disability Insurance   All persons hired on an IPSA will be covered for service incurred disability/injury/death, at no cost to the IPSA holder.  IPSA holders must be enrolled in the global Cigna “Group Life & Disability” insurance plan prescribed by UNDP which provides cover for death and permanent disability as a result of any cause. In the event of death and disability as a result of any cause, a claim must be submitted under the “Group Service-Incurred Death and Disability Insurance Plan” for compensation through Cigna.  The premium for the Cigna scheme must be paid by the UNDP Office in respect of each IPSA holder. The premium is established in US dollars. The local currency value must be determined monthly on the basis of the UN operational rate of exchange. The premium must be collected and remitted monthly at the time of processing the remuneration.  The UNDP Office must maintain a record in its ERP system of amounts collected, should there be any questions or audit at a later date.  For this premium amount, subject to the Cigna policies in place, the IPSA holder would be eligible to receive up to the ceiling established under this benefit for permanent total disability and, in the event of the IPSA holder’s death, the surviving spouse and/or dependents would receive up to the ceiling established under this benefit.  Claims for Death or Disability    In the event of death of an IPSA holder, the UNDP Office must promptly notify the insurance company. Information surrounding the death, contractual status and other documentation must be provided by the UNDP Office as requested by the insurance company.  In the event of a service incurred disability which prevents the IPSA holder from continuing to perform according to their agreement, a claim can be submitted under the “Group Service-Incurred Death and Disability Insurance Plan” for compensation through Cigna, or under the local scheme established by the UNDP Office.  Each UNDP Office must ensure it has a copy of the policy on file since the claim procedure is set forth therein. The current certification required by Cigna for settlement of death, service-incurred injury or disability claims is:  A report from the UN examining physician;  Evidence of valid IPSA at the time of death or disability; and  An indication that the premiums have been paid throughout the agreement.   The UNDP administering unit (GSSU) must have on file the original entry medical certification of the IPSA holder.  Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP)  IPSA holders who serve at, or travel at UNDP ’s expense to, a designated hazardous duty station are automatically covered by the Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP) and must therefore be included under the safety and security measures implemented by the UNDP Country Office under the Security Plan. Failure to comply with security instructions may render the insurance coverage null and void in so far as it relates to the IPSA holder in question. Furthermore, non-compliance with security instructions is grounds for termination of the IPSA for cause. The UNDP Office must therefore ensure that the information on MAIP and the relevant security instructions are available to IPSA holders.  All claims, together with supporting documentation, must be submitted by the IPSA holder to the local Human Resources Administrator, who is responsible for reviewing such claims and forwarding them to the HR Advisor at Headquarters serving the duty station in question.  Mandatory partially subsidized (lump sum) coverage not commutable to cash   The following partially-subsidized coverage is provided by UNDP in form of a lump sum, and is mandatory for the IPSA to ensure coverage, to cover possible risks against the individual or the organization. These benefits are mandatory and applicable as stated below.   Medical Insurance   Medical insurance is mandatory. IPSAs holders must have adequate medical insurance throughout their IPSA period with UNDP.  UNDP will provide a subsidy in the form of a fixed monthly lump sum specified in the table of entitlements (Annex 2), to subsidize part of the cost of the medical insurance.  In order to ensure that the coverage is adequate to UNDP’s global standards for personnel coverage, UNDP shall make available several schemes for the IPSA holder to select from.  IPSA holders must present proof of participation and coverage at the commencement of the IPSA, and take full responsibility for their own coverage and administration of that coverage.  Non subsidized coverages  The following coverage is to be obtained by the IPSA holder independently:   Medical Evacuation  Individuals engaged under IPSA are expected to obtain their own medical evacuation insurance as they are generally not eligible for medical evacuation unless they are on official travel status outside the duty station.  UNDP office shall make every effort to help facilitate the medical evacuation in cases of an emergency nature, where the service exists and is able to cater for such, and where the local health services are inadequate and the IPSA holder requests the assistance of UNDP. The cost for such medical evacuation shall be facilitated at the full cost of the IPSA holder.   Social Security and Pension Fund Arrangements   UNDP does not make additional payments for social security and pension fund towards IPSAs.  Optional coverage provided but not subsidized by UNDP  UNDP will make available a range of optional benefits and coverages to be accessed by individuals directly and at their own expense. It is understood that UNDP has entered into an agreement with each of the service providers with no corporate liability on itself, but is only availing of these services for the direct benefit and at the full cost and responsibility of the IPSA holder.  Working Hours   The working hours, UN official holidays and weekends for regular IPSA holders are aligned with those applicable to staff and other personnel in the duty station.   Leave  Annual leave  IPSA holders with regular IPSAs are eligible for paid annual leave of two and a half working days per month for rest purposes, which may be accumulated during the IPSA period, as specified below.  All annual leave is expected to be taken within the period of the IPSA agreement. If the IPSA agreement is extended for an additional period and funded from the same funding source/project, the IPSA may carry over accrued annual leave to the subsequent IPSA period. As of the annual leave cut-off date of 1 April of any given year, the annual leave balance (if any) will be re-set to a maximum of 24 days.   Unused paid annual leave is not commutable to cash unless it is approved and/or requested by the supervisor, for example, when the presence of the IPSA holder is required to perform their functions prior to separation within the notice period given, and where the budget is able to cater for this payment and charged fully to the current budget period of the funding source. The maximum number of annual leave days that may be commuted to cash is twenty-four (24).   Any absence from duty not specifically authorized, including any absence beyond the allowable time-off in accordance with this policy, will be treated as unauthorized absence and must be charged to unpaid leave.   Sick Leave  Eligible individuals who are unable to perform their duties because of illness or injury or whose attendance at work is prevented by public health requirements shall be granted sick leave in accordance with the terms of their IPSA.  Regular IPSA holders shall accrue credits towards sick leave at the rate of two working days for each month of service up to a maximum of 31 days (24 certified and 7 uncertified). Of those sick leave days accrued, a total of seven working days in an annual cycle starting 1 April of any year (subject to a maximum of two consecutive working days) may be taken as sick leave without providing a medical certificate from a duly recognized medical practitioner; or for family-related emergencies and/or obligations, such as in the event of a death in the IPSA holder’s immediate family or to take care of the IPSA holder’s child or an immediate family member who becomes ill.  Any absence supported by a medical certificate from a certified medical practitioner shall be considered as certified sick leave. The sick leave certificate from a certified medical practitioner must state that the individual is unable to perform his or her duties indicating the probable duration of the illness. In the event that the IPSA holder fails to provide the required supporting documents, the absence shall be charged to annual leave. Should the annual leave be exhausted, the absence shall be deducted from remuneration accordingly.  Medical reports must not be shared with non-authorized medical professionals including supervisors and heads of business unit.  IPSA holders must inform their supervisor of absences due to illness or injury on the same day of absence, except in emergency situations where the IPSA holder is unable to communicate this absence.  An IPSA holder may, in exceptional circumstances, be granted advanced sick leave up to a maximum of ten working days, provided that service under the IPSA is expected to continue for the period that is necessary to accrue the sick leave days so advanced.  Certified sick leave shall be recorded in units of full days and/or half-days.   In the event that the IPSA is extended for an additional period under the same position, the individual may carry over unused sick leave credits to the subsequent IPSA up to a maximum of 31 days. Sick leave credits will stop accruing when an IPSA holder has a balance of 31 unused sick leave days.   Sick leave during annual leave and/or hardship leave: An individual who is sick for more than five working days in any seven-day period while on annual leave and/or hardship leave, shall have that portion of the absence considered as sick leave upon presentation of satisfactory medical certification.  Sick leave shall not be granted instead of parental leave for birth parents.  Unused sick leave credits are not commutable to cash.  An IPSA holder may be required at any time to submit a medical report in relation to a health condition or to undergo a medical examination by a certified medical practitioner at the request of the Head of the Business Unit. Costs of the medical report will be reimbursed by UNDP, unless such an exam is covered by an insurance.  The termination of an IPSA shall, from the date it is effective, terminate any possibility to claim sick leave credits.   In the event that an individual surpasses the sick leave credits limit during the IPSA period, the excess period will be charged against accrued annual leave. Should the annual leave be exhausted, the IPSA holder may be played on special leave without pay, otherwise any further absence shall be deducted from the remuneration accordingly.  If the individual is not eligible for paid sick leave, managers should exercise the highest possible degree of flexibility in accepting unpaid leave due to illness. Only in such cases where the extent or timing of absences prevents the individual from delivering the services as specified in the terms of reference may the manager consider a termination of the IPSA due to illness.   Computation of Annual and Sick Leave  When the IPSA start date falls on the 1st of the month: Full leave entitlements.   When the IPSA start date falls between the 2nd and the 16th of the month: two days annual leave and one day sick leave for that calendar month.  When the IPSA start date falls on the 17th of the month or later: one day annual leave and one day sick leave for that calendar month.  When the IPSA end date falls between the 1st and the 16th of the month: one day annual leave and one day sick leave for that calendar month.   When IPSA end date falls on the 17th of the month or later, but not on the last day of the month: two days annual leave and one day sick leave.  Part-time IPSAs will have their starting and ending annual and sick leave totals pro-rated to reflect their part-time schedule.     Parental Leave (for the birth parent):   IPSA holders on regular IPSAs are eligible for 16 consecutive weeks of paid parental leave for the birth parent.  Extensions of parental leave for birth parents may be granted on the basis of unpaid leave, regardless of contract durations for regular IPSAs.  Parental leave for the birth parent must fall within and be taken during the IPSA period. Where the parental leave started during the IPSA period but the IPSA is due to expire during the period of the parental leave, the IPSA will be extended for the purpose of covering the full 16-week duration of the parental leave. There is no expectation or obligation to extend beyond the above extension to accommodate the parental leave for the birth parent if the original position was not envisaged to be longer. No leave will be accumulated during the extended period.  Individuals must submit the request for parental leave at least three months prior to the anticipated start date and the request should be accompanied by a certification from a doctor or midwife stating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD).  Parental leave for birth parents must begin between two and six weeks prior to EDD and be taken in one consecutive period.  Annual leave will accrue during the period of parental leave.  Time-off to breastfeed infants up to two years old, is in accordance with UNDP’s policy on Time Off for Breastfeeding.   Parental Leave (for non-birth parent)  IPSA holders on regular IPSAs are eligible for four weeks of paid parental leave.  Parental leave for non-birth parents may be taken in either one or two fixed periods during the first 12 months from the birth of their child.  IPSA holders must submit their request for parental leave within a reasonable period of not less than two weeks prior to the expected start of the parental leave, in agreement with the supervisor, and the request should be accompanied by a certification from a doctor or midwife stating the EDD to be followed by a copy of the child’s birth certificate.  Parental leave for non-birth parents is limited to one occurrence per 12 months, regardless of the number of children born during that 12-month period.  Parental leave for non-birth parents must fall within and be taken during the IPSA period. Unused parental leave is not commutable to cash. The IPSA must not be extended solely in order to exercise the unused portion of the parental leave.  Unpaid Leave:  In emergency situations the Head of the Business Unit may exercise flexibility in allowing unpaid leave for up to twelve months at the IPSA holder’s request, subject to exigencies of service, for individuals who have been on a continuous IPSA for at least 36months.  In conjunction with parental leave of birth parents, IPSA holders may also be eligible for unpaid leave immediately following the parental leave for up to eight additional months. The 36-month eligibility stated above does not apply in such a case.  The Head of the Business Unit may also exercise at their own decision to apply unpaid leave to an individual on IPSA without any notice period. Such decisions should only be made in cases or serious breach or identified conflict of interest, or of similar seriousness, and only in full consultation with the Office of Legal services and/or Ethics Office.   Unpaid leave shall not be granted until paid leave provisions, when applicable, have been exhausted.  Unpaid leave must be approved in advance by the supervisor and Head of the Business Unit.  Unpaid leave will normally only be allowed in the following circumstances:   In connection with parental leave; In relation to illness; In relation to family/personal reasons; and similar emergency situations; For deployment or assignment to another office within UNDP, academic research,  lecturing or advancement of a relevant expertise through special trainings.  When applicable, annual and sick leave will not accumulate during unpaid leave periods of 30 days or longer.  When applicable, there will not be health or life insurance coverage during periods of unpaid leave of 30 days or longer.   Jury Duty, Other Appearances in Court and Military Service:   PSA holders serving on jury duty will be granted leave with pay by the  Head of the Business Unit up to a maximum of five working days in a calendar year, in units of full or half days as certified by the court.  Court appearances at UNDP’s request should be recorded as absence on official business.  Court appearances as a party in the IPSA holder’s personal capacity and not at the request of UNDP will be charged to annual leave or unpaid leave.  For court appearances as a witness in the IPSA holder’s personal capacity, the heads of business units at other locations shall decide whether the absence is to be charged to annual leave or special paid or unpaid leave, according to the circumstances of the case.  IPSA holders may be granted unpaid leave for military training or service required by their government at the discretion of the Head of the Business Unit.   Time off for Voting in Elections:   IPSA holders wishing to exercise their right to vote on election days should try to do so outside their normal working hours. Those who are unable to do so should request up to two hours of time off from their Head of the Business Unit. However, upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that voting may take longer, the Heads of Business Units may grant up to four hours of time off subject to the exigencies of service.   Hardship Leave:  IPSA holders with agreements of six months or longer based in duty stations designated as hardship duty stations D and E, are eligible for a paid hardship leave of two working days per month to recover from working in a designated hardship duty station and to allow IPSA holders to stock up on basic goods needed for everyday life which are not necessarily available at the designated duty station. Once an IPSA holder under an International IPSA has accrued six days of hardship leave, no additional hardship leave days can be accrued unless the accrued days are utilized.  All hardship leave must be taken within the period of the IPSA and subject to a maximum of six consecutive working days at a time. If the IPSA is extended for an additional period, the IPSA holder may carry over accrued leave to the subsequent agreement period up to a maximum of six days as of the cut-off date of 1 April of any given year.  Unused hardship leave is not commutable to cash.  For Regular IPSAs where the starting or ending months are of less than one full calendar month, hardship leave shall be pro-rated to the nearest half day.  When an IPSA of an initial duration of less than six months is subsequently extended to reach or exceed six months, provisions for hardship leave will apply from the effective date of the IPSA extension. Leave is not accumulated retroactively.  Leave Provisions on IPSA Extension:   When an IPSA of an initial duration of less than six months is subsequently extended to reach or exceed six months, provisions for annual leave and sick leave will start to apply subject to the eligibility as specified in this policy, from the effective date of the IPSA extension. Leave is not accumulated retroactively.  Travel for Work  Travel for work outside the country of duty station shall always be on economy class for IPSA holders, regardless of travel time. Travel arrangements shall follow the regular procedures as established for corporate travel, and DSA is paid regularly during travel for work outside the country of the duty station as per the corporate travel policy.  Performance Evaluation  Service monitoring and performance evaluation are mandatory for regular IPSAs as part of a process to provide regular feedback about individual performance and progress achieved against agreed terms of reference, as well as objectives and results. Performance of the IPSA holder must be communicated to the IPSA throughout the duration of the IPSA.  In this context, the purpose of the Performance Evaluation is to:  Review progress against agreed upon terms of reference and objectives;  Provide feedback on the performance of the individual IPSA holder; and  Make informed decisions on contractual matters (extension, non-renewal).  For regular IPSA holders, a full- service evaluation report must be completed, using the online PMD platform for any service period exceeding six months worked during that evaluation year. Where the PMD platform is not available or for short-term IPSA holders, the IPSA Service Evaluation form in Annex 5 can be used.   For short-term IPSAs, or for periods of service of less than six months, only section I of the IPSA Performance Evaluation form is to be completed and should be documented as a note to file.  Each Service Evaluation form must be filed for record keeping by the human resources focal point of the Business Unit, or online when available.   Learning Opportunities  IPSA holders must complete any corporate mandatory training courses within the required time established by UNDP.  IPSA holders who have been on IPSA continuously for at least twelve months may have access to learning and development opportunities available to UNDP personnel, including access to formal programmes (in line with the target audiences and requirements established for such programmes), on-demand learning resources, and the UNDP learning management system/platform(s), and only if such trainings are deemed to be necessary due to the natural progression of the function and its requirements.  The proforma cost of the IPSA will include a contribution to the UNDP corporate Learning Reserve to enable IPSA holders’ access to the initiatives funded from the Learning Reserve and resources that are offered to UNDP personnel at no cost. Any additional costs related to the participation in the UNDP corporate learning and development programmes and other relevant costs will be charged to the funding source(s) of the respective IPSA holders, as needed.  IPSA holders may be requested to undergo specific trainings if found to be necessary by the hiring managers to deliver on services requiring technical skills beyond those originally identified in the TORs.  Regular IPSA holders are eligible for detail assignments, provided that the requirements of both the releasing and receiving offices, as well as their host countries allow for that, and that the individual is adequately covered with health insurance while on assignment.   Career Paths  IPSA holders will have access to career opportunities within UNDP as well as to the career development resources available to UNDP personnel. As such, they will be able to apply to UNDP staff positions and positions offered under other contractual modalities, in line with the UNDP recruitment and selection framework, and the requirements of the respective positions and offers.   IPSA holders who have served a minimum of three years with UNDP and have demonstrated successful performance, as recorded in the formal performance reviews, will be eligible to participate in the corporate talent pool assessments and similar initiatives as internal candidates. All IPSA holders will be able to participate in such initiatives, when open to external candidates.  IPSAs shall not be considered internal candidates for vacancy announcements that have been categorized as internal, regardless of time spent on IPSA contracts.    Roles and Responsibilities  Heads of Business Units / Responsible Officers:   Heads of Business Unit (incl. Resident Representatives, UNV/UNCDF Executive Coordinator, UNOSSC Director, or other individuals delegated authority hereunder) are designated as Responsible Offices, responsible for enforcing the terms of this policy and are accountable for decisions taken. Directors must consider the performance of the Responsible Officers in managing the IPSA in accordance with this policy in the annual performance review of Heads of Office e.g. Audit Reports and OHR reports may be used as a reference for evaluation.  Responsible Officers:  defining clear terms of reference with measurable outputs, timelines, and indicating qualifications and competencies required; determining the use of IPSA as the appropriate contractual modality and adhering to the requirements of this policy; ensuring availability of funds for the duration of the IPSA and extension; contracting the most qualified candidate in a transparent and competitive manner; and service monitoring and evaluation, recommendation for level of payment and IPSA extensions. exercising delegation of authority on the issuance of IPSAs; ensuring that a transparent and competitive selection process is instituted for IPSAs in their respective office; monitoring the transparency and competitive selection process for IPSAs in their respective office; managing the conflict resolution process in accordance with the IPSA and in consultation with the Legal Office and theBMS/OHR Policy Unit as set forth in this Guide.   The HR Focal Point & GSSC   Before issuing the IPSA, HR must ensure that the policy is complied with and that the IPSA template is used for contracting the services of the individual. No deviations to the model IPSA template can be made without consultation with, and clearance of, the BMS/OHR Policy Unit and BMS/OLS.   GSSC Focal Points are responsible for: coordinating and administering the recruitment process; coordinating the contracting process of the candidates; issuing the IPSA including the applicable conditions of service and the non-career nature of the work; Management of IPSAs in the UNDP ERP system’s HR module; ensuring payment of monthly remuneration according to terms of IPSA; ensuring that adequate social security provisions are in place; maintaining a roster of candidates in the various categories, and maintaining records for monitoring and reporting purposes.   IPSAs are paid through UNDP’s GSSC/Global Payroll.    BMS/OHR Business Partners:    BMS/OHR Business Partners are responsible for providing advisory support and guidance in the administration and application of IPSAs. They are also responsible for monitoring the correct and appropriate use of the IPSA and taking necessary action to prevent misuse.  Office of Audit and Investigation (OAI):  OAI will audit the use of IPSAs by the UNDP Offices and report on its findings at any time OAI deems necessary.   Oversight, Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting:   The Responsible Officers, Business Partners, GSSC and the respective HR Unit should use the information available in the UNDP ERP database to act on their respective responsibility for oversight, monitoring and / or evaluation on the use of IPSAs.  Organizational score cards or benchmarks will be established on a periodic basis to ensure the reporting, monitoring and evaluation of the use of IPSAs.  Annexes Annex 1 – Recruitment standards and procedures for IPSAs Annex 2 – Overview of IPSA benefits Annex 3 - Definition of functions of inherent and continuous nature Annex 4 - IPSA pay ranges and identifying the right level  Annex 5 – Performance evaluation  Annex 6 – Checklist of inclusions in IPSA personnel file  Annex 7 – Equipment and supplies  Annex 8 - Transitional measures    Annex 1: Recruitment standards and procedures for IPSAs.    For the selection of IPSAs, the selection process must adhere to the general principles listed in the UNDP’s Recruitment and Selection Framework Policy to ensure that the person selected is the best-qualified candidate to perform the job functions in a fully satisfactory manner. These principles are:  Competition: Selection will follow a visible and fair competitive process for all vacancies, regardless of post, contractual modality or hiring unit;  Objectivity: Screening will be conducted with professional rigor, with candidates measured against clearly articulated criteria, job skills and competencies and corporate priorities;  Transparency: The recruitment and selection criteria and all phases of recruitment processes will be transparent to candidates to the fullest extent possible;  Diversity: UNDP’s workforce will reflect diversity and will strive to include equal numbers of men and women, and individuals from under-represented groups, indigenous groups and persons with disabilities;  Non-Discrimination: Subject to the principle of recruiting personnel on as wide a geographical basis as possible, UNDP will not discriminate in its recruitment and selection processes on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, family status or disability; and  Accountability: Hiring managers will be held accountable both for their selection proposals and the manner in which they have followed the processes leading up to them.  Other fundamental conditions:  Recruitment of Government Personnel: Any candidate who is a government employee must disclose this relationship prior to being engaged on an IPSA. As a rule, candidates who are employed by a government or a government entity are expected to resign from said employment upon acceptance of an IPSA with UNDP. In cases where candidates continue to be employed or affiliated with a government institution or other authority external to UNDP must provide evidence that they have been accorded special leave without pay, or a similar status, from their employer prior to being engaged under an IPSA. Notwithstanding the disclosure, the individual engaged under an IPSA Service Contract is bound by the principle of impartiality as specified in the agreement.  Obligation of Confidentiality: Everyone who is involved in a selection process, in one capacity or another (e.g., long-listing, short-listing, interview panel, etc.) must engage in these such activities maintaining strict confidentiality. A selection process is not completed until all the different selection, review and clearance steps have been taken. It is therefore expected that no information be shared with the candidates or others not involved in the selection process until the final approval for the selection has been signed   Selection Modalities and Procedures:     Unless a competitive selection is considered not practicable, each recruitment and selection must include the following:  i)  Vacancy announcement of a budgeted and classified IPSA post; ii) Competitive, job-specific objective assessment of skills and competencies as well as a competitive assessment of corporate values and ethics.  A thorough verification of relevant qualifications and credentials, including thorough reference checks must be completed in every case.   A. Selection by competitive process     A competitive recruitment process is the standard procedure for recruiting regular IPSAs.   To ensure competitiveness, the shortlist must be comprised of at least two candidates, but ideally three or more. At least one woman should be included on the short-list. If no female candidate is included on the short-list, the Hiring Unit must document the efforts that have been made to identify qualified female candidates including re-advertisement. Where only one qualified candidate has been identified, the Hiring Unit must document the efforts that have been made to identify additional candidates, and secure approval from the BMS/OHR Business Partner before proceeding further.   For short-term IPSAs, an assessment and review of the profiles or CVs at least two qualifying candidates is required and should be documented and presented to the Head of the Business Unit for their selection decision.   B. Direct recruitment of a previously assessed candidate  This option allows offices to hire a candidate who has been assessed through a competitive process for the same job function and level, and who has passed the threshold in a previous recruitment process completed within the previous 36 months.   Individuals who had previously been assessed for similar positions and had passed the threshold but were ranked below the candidate selected within the past 36 months, may be placed on an HR roster. Hiring managers should preferably interview the individual to ascertain that the individual is interested in the position and to reconfirm their suitability.     A hiring unit may also transfer an IPSA holder from one project or position to another in the same duty station with identical functions, and the same band/level and remuneration, without a new competitive process, provided that the candidate has a satisfactory performance record. In such instances a new IPSA contract must be issued. It must also be noted that by doing so, the time of service of the IPSA holder is not reset in such case, if there is no break between the contracts.      For the purposes of this Policy, “similar position” shall mean a position under the same contract modality (IPSA), grade and band with two or less changes to the stated functions.     C. Direct recruitment from a roster that has been formally recognized by UNDP   UNDP business units may also use a roster of pre–assessed candidates, in accordance with locally established roster procedures without having to go through a full process outlined in Section A. above. The selection from the roster remains subject to the approval of the Head of the Business Unit.    Where one or more suitable candidates is/are identified by the Head of the Business Unit , the remuneration to be offered will be calculated by the unit using the remuneration setting tool as relevant to the role described in the TORs and the duty station.    In such cases, a review or assessment process is not necessary. The recommendation and the criteria must be documented.    For certain roles, UNDP may access formally established personnel rosters of other UN, recognised multi-lateral international organizations and International Financial Institutions (IFI) to source suitable personnel. It is at the Hiring Manager’s discretion to select external partner personnel, through the clearance of the Regional HR Business Partner.     D. Direct selection of a candidate    The UNDP Administrator, Associate Administrator or their delegates (RB Directors and Deputies, UNV or UNCDF Executive Coordinator, and UNOSSC Director) may hire a candidate on any IPSA position directly.    In instances where business needs prevail, for example, in emergency response situations, the Head of the Business Unit (RRs/DRRs in country offices) may select individuals directly and contract them under a short-term IPSA, provided the candidate meets the requirements of the position.   E. Review and assessment of at least 2 candidates (for short-term IPSAs only)   A hiring unit may proceed to a competitive selection via a review and assessment of at least 2 qualified candidates CVs/P11s.    Assessment procedures:   The assessment procedures used to evaluate candidates for a specific position may vary depending on the position requirements.    The Hiring Manager, in consultation with the HR focal point, will decide on the assessment methodologies to be used to best determine the suitability of the candidate for the position, as well as the relative weight to be assigned to each assessment technique. In order to ensure transparency, Hiring Managers are required to account fully for all techniques used and relative weights assigned.    To ensure a fair and equal assessment of all candidates, assessments for the same position must be conducted following the same assessment methods.   A. Interview panel  The Hiring Unit can establish an ad hoc panel made up of at least three UNDP members of personnel, either FTA or PSA holders habitually at the same level or higher as that of the IPSA position under assessment. The panel will normally be chaired by a FTA holder, however, when this is not possible, the Head of the Business Unit may authorize the chair of the interview panel to be the PSA holder holding the highest level. Due consideration should be given to diversity and gender considerations, as appropriate for the duty station. The panel provides its recommendation to the Head of the Business Unit for a final decision.  Note: Notwithstanding that programme delivery increasingly relies upon building a close partnership with governments, participation of national counterparts or government officials on UNDP interview panels is generally discouraged but may be permissible in the capacity of “observer”.  In considering if a national counterpart or government official will participate in a panel as an observer, Hiring Units must fully consider the principle of independence as articulated in the United Nations Charter, and determine whether or not such participation would compromise the actual, or perceived, independence of UNDP.  B. Technical assessments   It is important to ensure candidates can deliver the technical aspects of the role. The Hiring Unit has several options to confirm this aspect of the candidate’s profile. This includes psychometric and skill-based assessments offered internally or through an external firm; Asynchronous interviews through a provider such as Vid-cruter; A technical phone screen, writing sample or assessment. The Hiring Unit must share a rubric to assist with evaluating the response from the candidate.  C. Panel desk reviews  Candidates can be assessed using full panel desk reviews A full panel desk review, includes in addition to the review of a candidate’s CV, the review of written responses to the competency-based questions. A full panel desk review can be used to assess both regular and short-term IPSAs.    D. Review and assessment of CVs/P11s  An assessment and review of CVs/P11s can be used ONLY to assess short-term IPSAs.       Preparation of the long-list and short-list   Only candidates who fully meet the required qualifications for the position, as specified in the vacancy announcement, may be short-listed for the post. However, candidates who are within six months of the minimum relevant experience requirement may be considered in situations where a business case is made. The business reason must be documented and on record for the file.  To ensure competitiveness, the shortlist must be comprised of at least two candidates. At least one woman should be included on the short-list. If no female candidate is included on the short-list, the Hiring Unit must document the efforts that have been made to identify qualified female candidates including re-advertisement. Hiring units must ensure that every application to a position is afforded due consideration, and that there is an objective reason provided for including, or not including, candidates on long-lists and short-lists.   The Head of the Business Unit is responsible and accountable for the quality of the long-list and short-list.   Annex 2: Overview of IPSA benefits         Annex 3: Definition of functions of inherent and continuous nature    Definition of functions of Inherent Nature:   Activities of an inherent nature to the UN are those which require the exercise of substantial discretion in applying UN authority and/or in making decisions for the UN. The activities normally fall into two categories: a) the exercise of high-level authority or b) the establishment of procedures and processes related to the oversight of monetary transactions or entitlements. An inherently UN activity involves:    a. \tBinding UNDP to take or not to take some action by contract, public pronouncement or otherwise;   Determining, protecting, and advancing the interests of the United Nations, by diplomatic means or political means or otherwise;   Significantly affecting the safety and security or property of persons;  Exerting ultimate control over the acquisition, use, or disposition of United Nations property (real or personal, tangible or intangible);   Establishing policies or procedures for the collection, control, or disbursement of funds;   Acting as internal control custodian of the organization. The list below contains an example of such functions that must be held by staff, as specified in UNDP’s internal control framework:    2nd Authority  -  Approving  Managers  and  Global  Payroll Administrator  3rd Authority  -  Disbursing  Officer and  Disbursing  Officer - Payroll  HR Administrator and Position Administrator  Bank Account Signatory  Trust Fund Manager  Bank reconciliation Approver  Safe custodian  Supplemental roles of: Vendor Approvers, Override match exceptions, Fund manager and Retirement of assets   As such, administering or managing a selection process in accordance with the UNDP standard policies and established processes is not considered an “inherent function”. However, deciding what rules to put into the corporate manuals and policies or making exceptions to such policies, in the interests of the UN is an “inherent function”;    Representing the organization, such as negotiating and deciding with governments or external partners, or deciding on which business line to focus, is considered an “inherent function”. When in doubt, BMS/OHR shall consult with BMS/OFM to determine what is considered an inherent function.      Definition of functions of a continuous nature:    The functions are of continuous nature when the position is primarily core funded (>50%), and      The functions performed under the position are not meant to indirectly support a specific, limited in time, kind of initiative/project, such as a specific business development engagement, study visit, consultancy, specific training, etc.   The position covered by the IPSA is not a temporary replacement of a UNDP post where the staff member incumbent is on an extended leave, such as maternity, paternity, special leave, etc.    Annex 4: IPSA pay ranges and identifying the right level   Identifying the right level as per functions:   IB1 (P1-P2): Basic knowledge, more theoretical than practical and less managerial capacity, basic analysis; capacity to apply unpaid concepts. Basic professional competence, expectations to grow the individual from conceptual understanding to applied knowledge.    IB2 (P3-P4): Solid understanding of the technicality of the position requirements; initiating new understandings and application of knowledge into policies or programmes in a specific subject area or field of work. This may range from solid professional (theory and practice) who anchors a substantive team to a specialist who is recognized for conceptual applied mastery, innovates new approaches, can work with specialized substantive teams.    IB3 (P5- D1/P6 Expert Roles): Integration of substantive specialization to provide a comprehensive platform for service; delivery of world-renowned expertise recognized by the peer community; expanding and extending capacities and services into new fields. Advanced programme renowned expert, integrates substantive specializations, devises ground-breaking initiatives.    IB4 (D1/P6-D2/P7)- mostly highly technical senior roles, sometimes Expert roles at D2 level: Politically and substantively prescient.  World-class senior-level expert.    Pay ranges:  The pay ranges for international PSAs applicable globally to all IPSAs are set as follows, in US Dollars:     Exceptions to paying individuals beyond the set maximum may be approved in very exceptional cases by the Director of the Bureau of Management Services, following a recommendation by the relevant Bureau Director/UNV or UNCDF Executive Coordinator, or UNOSSC Director.     Retainer IPSAs:   The remuneration is calculated based on the regular IPSA remuneration, and the following formula would apply:   Daily-based pay: The monthly remuneration divided by 21.75  Hourly-based pay: The daily remuneration divided by 8  Monthly-based pay: As per the regular pay ranges in the chart above   Output-based, converted to periodic pay: Estimated duration to produce the output is used to determine the remuneration, then divided by the expected number of days to set the daily remuneration.     Annex 5: Performance Evaluation  Short-Term IPSA:   For short-term IPSAs, only section I of the IPSA Annual Performance Review template needs to be completed.   Regular IPSA:   For regular IPSAs, the evaluation must be completed using the online PMD platform. If the platform is not available, the supervisor can use the form below. Please note that the entire evaluation form needs to be completed.    The IPSA Annual Performance review must be completed by the supervisor in line with the regular performance management cycles as set out by the administration, and applying the same cycle consistently across all personnel (calendar year). The simplified performance management process is initiated at the start of the year with clearly set goals to achieve as per the work plan of the unit and the individual, as well as learning and development plans of the individual, and agreed on by the supervisor. The performance assessment is conducted within the regular set schedule at the start of the following year and conducted against the set goals. The assessment by the supervisor is completed after:     a short written self-assessment is provided by the IPSA holder including on their special accomplishments; and    a Performance review session with the individual IPSA holder with a view to discuss performance during the reporting period.    The performance assessment must include details regarding performance during the review period, as applicable, any mention of service provided above or below expected standards or in addition to those activities established in the TOR. If the PMD platform is not available, the IPSA Annual Performance Review template should be used for evaluating regular IPSAs.    Annex 6: To be included in IPSA file, where applicable – Checklist    Check list of documentation for the IPSA holder   Evidence of approved budget   Terms of Reference   Certification of appropriateness of functions for use of an IPSA   Confirmation of remuneration level (e.g. costing sheet)   Minutes of the Ad-hoc panel with relevant supporting engagement documents   Reference check report   Letter of IPSA offer – signed by the individual   Medical certification from recognized Physician   Copies of professional qualifications in line with IPSA level   Signed IPSA form with acknowledgement of conditions of service   Proof of medical coverage   Application for CIGNA medical coverage   Application for Death and Disability coverage   Signed acknowledgement that IPSA holder has received all documents and information related to social security and MAIP coverage   Amendments/Extensions to IPSA-with signed acceptance   Birth Certificate of IPSA holder and designated beneficiary   Bank details authorization for direct deposit of remuneration (or vendor form)  Service Evaluation/IPSA Extension Form   Minutes of the selection, where applicable   Termination notification, where applicable    Annex 7: Equipment & Supplies   Any equipment or supplies that may be furnished by UNDP to the IPSA holder for the performance of the IPSA holder’s obligations  under  the  IPSA remains the property of  UNDP,  and  any  such equipment or supplies must be returned to UNDP at the conclusion of the IPSA or before if no longer needed by the IPSA holder. Such equipment, when returned to UNDP, must be in the same condition as when delivered to the IPSA holder, subject to normal wear and tear, and the IPSA holder will be liable to compensate UNDP for any damage or degradation of the equipment that is beyond normal wear and tear.       Annex 8: Transitional measures  From the date of entry into force of this policy on 15th February 2021, all new international, non-staff hires against tasks which are not lump-sum based will be on IPSA, and the remuneration calculation will follow the formula introduced by this policy.   Also, from 15th February 2021, the use of the IC agreement will be limited to lump sum-based activities only. All other activities for which the services of an individual contractor are not based on a lump sum against specific deliverables will be undertaken on the basis of an IPSA. It is therefore envisaged that a number of ICs who fall under this category will be transitioned to IPSA upon expiry of their existing contracts or before 1st January 2022, whichever is earlier. For example, should an IC with activities that are not lump-sum-based have an expiration date of 31 March 2021, an extension to that should be through a conversion to an IPSA as of 1 April 2021. Current IC agreements which are not lump-sum based may be extended on ICs any time before 15th of February for periods that may not exceed 31 December 2021.  During the transition period throughout 2021, the conversion of ICs to IPSAs shall not require a new selection process if under the same TORs and are classified and paid at similar levels. When transitioned, the new remuneration formula of the IPSA shall apply, and the newly introduced benefits for the IPSA, where applicable, will apply as of their respective IPSA effective starting date.   The effective date of entry into force of this Policy is 15th February 2021.    ",
    "internship": " Internship  The internship policy provides guidance on the UNDP internship programme and provides information on the administration of UNDP interns.  Purpose  The purpose of the Internship programme is to provide students and recent graduates from diverse academic backgrounds exposure to development issues and a first-hand experience with the day-to-day working environment of UNDP, either in person or remotely.  Eligibility  Applicants to the UNDP internship programme must at the time of application meet one of the following requirements: Be enrolled in a postgraduate degree programme (such as a master’s programme, or higher); Be enrolled in the final academic year of a first university degree programme (such as bachelor’s degree or equivalent); Have recently graduated with a university degree (as defined in (a) and (b) above) and, if selected, must start the internship within one-year of graduation; Be enrolled in a postgraduate professional traineeship program and undertake the internship as part of this program.  A person who is the child or sibling of a UNDP staff member is not eligible to apply for an internship at UNDP. An applicant who bears any other family relationship with a UNDP staff member may be engaged as an intern, provided that they must neither be assigned to the same work unit of the staff member nor be placed under the direct or indirect supervision of the staff member.  For purposes of this policy, “child” means: (i) the adult child of a staff member; (ii) the adult child of the spouse of a staff member (stepchild); and (iii) the spouse of an adult child of a staff member or the child of a staff member’s spouse (son- or daughter-in-law). “Sibling” includes the adult child of both or either parent of a staff member and the adult child of the spouse of a parent of a staff member (that is, also half- and stepsibling).  Status\t  Interns are not considered as having the status of a staff member. During the internship with UNDP, interns are subject to the Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission (ST/SGB/2002/9).  Interns must not be engaged as substitutes to supplement or replace staff members and must not encumber authorized posts.  Interns must not represent UNDP in any official capacity or commit resources on its behalf.  Interns are expected to fulfil the terms of their internships. Therefore, the internship period must not be foreshortened for the purposes of allowing an intern to be appointed to another type of staff or non-staff position.  Duration of Internship Assignments  Internship assignments vary in length according to the academic requirements of the intern, as well as the needs of UNDP. Assignments normally last a minimum of six weeks and a maximum of six months. An internship may last up to nine months if the intern can demonstrate that it will award them an educational credit for a course.  Internship assignments completed as part of national service obligations or a postgraduate professional traineeship program may last up to 12 months.    Internship assignments are available on a part-time and full-time basis.  Locations  Internships offered to candidates should take into account geographical diversity, ensuring a balance between those that reside in the country of the duty station where the internship is offered and those coming from, or residing abroad.   In-person internships must not be offered at any UNDP Office that is in a location that is  designated as a non-family or high-risk duty station.   All UNDP Offices may offer virtual or remote internships that do not require any in-person presence at the office (remote internship) in accordance with the provisions of this policy.  Responsibilities and obligations of receiving offices and supervisors  The administration of interns is decentralized to the respective bureau, office or country office that is receiving the intern (the ‘receiving office’ or ‘receiving offices’).  The receiving office and supervisors must create a working environment conducive to interns’ substantive learning and professional development. Receiving offices must:  Ensure that an intern’s assignment is at the appropriate level of complexity and variety; Ensure proper supervision of the intern; Ensure that the intern is informed of UNDP’s policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Abuse of Authority and Sexual Exploitation and Abuse; Prepare terms of reference describing the tasks to be performed during the internship; and Provide constructive feedback to the intern regarding their performance.    Where a remote internship is offered, the receiving office and supervisor should  ensure that the guidance entitled “How to engage interns remotely” (Annex 1), is followed.    Responsibilities and obligations of interns   Interns must:  Observe all applicable rules, regulations, instructions, procedures and directives of UNDP notwithstanding their status as described in paragraph 6 of this policy; Provide the receiving office with a copy of all materials prepared by them during the internship. UNDP is entitled to all property rights, including but not limited to patents, copyrights and trademarks, with regards to material that bears a direct relation to, or is made in consequence of, the services provided under the internship. At the request of UNDP, the interns must assist in securing such property rights and transferring them to UNDP in compliance with the requirements of the applicable law; Respect the impartiality and independence required of the United Nations and of the receiving office and must not seek or accept instructions regarding the services performed under the internship agreement from any Government or from any authority external to UNDP; Unless otherwise authorized by the receiving office, an intern may not communicate at any time to the media or to any institution, person, Government or any other external party any information that has become known to them by any reason of their association with the United Nations, UNDP or the receiving office, that they know or ought to have known has not been made public. They may not use any such information without the written authorization of the receiving office, and such information may never be used for personal gain. These obligations also apply after the end of the internship with UNDP; Refrain from any conduct that would adversely reflect on the United Nations, UNDP, or the receiving office and will not engage in any activity which is incompatible with the aims and objectives of the United Nations or UNDP; Comply with local laws and customs, including any taxation requirements.  The conditions regulating both in-person and remote internships are set out in an internship agreement. Further conditions regulating a remote internship are set out in a supplementary agreement for remote internships to be signed in addition to the internship agreement.   Failure to comply with the requirements in paragraph 19, as well as those contained in the internship agreement between UNDP and the intern and in the supplementary agreement for remote internship when applicable, may result in the immediate termination of the internship agreement by UNDP without compensation.   Third-party claims  UNDP is not responsible for any claims by any parties where the loss of or damage to their property, death or personal injury was caused by the actions or omission of action by the interns during their internship.   Stipend  Where an intern is engaged in-person and is not financially supported by any institution or programme, such as a university, Government, foundation or scholarship programme, a stipend intended to help cover basic daily expenses related to an in-person internship, such as meals and transportation at the duty station, must be paid by the receiving office.   Where an intern is engaged remotely and is not financially supported by any institution or programme, such as a university, Government, foundation or scholarship programme, a remote stipend intended to help cover expenses related to the internship, such as internet connections or other means to remain in contact with the receiving office, must be paid by the receiving office.   The amount of the stipend for in-person and remote internships will be set for each duty station. The monthly stipend rates of both remote and in-person internships will be published annually by the Bureau for Management Services’ Office of Human Resources (BMS/OHR). The stipend will be paid on a monthly basis and will be pro-rated for part-time internship arrangements.  Where an intern is financially supported by an institution, Government or third party, UNDP will, subject to the rules of such institution, Government or third party, pay the intern the difference, if any, between the external financial support provided and the applicable UNDP stipend.  No other payments of any kind, or advance on the stipend due, will be made to an intern by the receiving office in connection with an internship agreement, except for any reimbursements made to an intern under paragraph 33 of the present policy.  Interns will accrue combined sick and annual leave at the rate of 1 ½ days per month, which will be prorated to the nearest half day for part-time internships. Any accrued leave days not used by the end of the internship will be forfeited. Any unjustified absences during the internship period exceeding a total of nine days or as prorated for part-time internships, will be deducted from the monthly stipend.  Interns’ expenses and insurance  Costs and arrangements for travel, visas, passports, accommodation and living expenses are the responsibility of: The sponsoring institution, related institution or Government, which may provide the required financial assistance to its students; or The intern.  Interns, whether engaged in-person or remotely, are responsible for securing adequate medical insurance for the duration of their internship with UNDP and must provide self certification of good health prior to starting the internship. UNDP will not reimburse the medical insurance of the intern. Any costs arising from accidents and illness incurred during an internship assignment will be the responsibility of the intern.   Selected candidates for in-person internships must show proof of valid medical insurance for the duty station in which they will intern. For interns  that are neither nationals nor residents of the duty station of the internship, the insurance must include adequate coverage in the event of an injury or illness during the internship duration which:  Requires transportation to the home country or country of residence for further treatment; Results in death and requires preparation and return of the remains to the home country, or country of residence.  UNDP accepts no responsibility for loss or damage to personal effects that may occur during the internship.   UNDP’s expenses  Expenses incurred by interns, including undertaking official travel at the request of UNDP, in the discharge of the activities related to the internship are reimbursed by UNDP on the same basis as costs incurred by staff members or costs reimbursed to staff members, including payment of daily subsistence allowance and additional insurance coverage, as applicable.  Working Conditions  When completing an in-person internship in a UNDP Office, interns must be provided with the workspace and equipment necessary to accomplish the activities related to the internship.  When completing a remote internship, interns will be responsible for providing their own equipment, internet and communication access and work space.  The internship, whether in-person or remote, may be performed using flexible working arrangements if:  The receiving office agrees in writing to accept an intern on the basis of flexible working arrangements; and The intern agrees that they are required to work the equivalent of a minimum of at least six weeks on a full-time basis. An internship under such arrangements must be completed within a six-month period.  Termination  The internship can be terminated by either UNDP or the intern for any reason upon giving two weeks’ notice.  Selection, Recording, Evaluation and Certification  Internships must be published electronically, either individually, or generically when filling a roster.  Interns must be competitively selected from as wide a geographical basis as possible without distinction as to race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or religion.  Once the internship agreement, and when required, the supplementary agreement for remote internship are signed, the personnel records of the intern must be entered into the Quantum or designated ERP module.  At the end of the internship, the supervisor must prepare a written evaluation of the intern’s performance and organize a meeting with the intern to provide feedback.  Upon completion of the internship, the intern receives a certificate from UNDP.  Subsequent Employment  There is no expectation of employment with UNDP following an internship.   ANNEX 1  How to engage interns remotely  UNDP’s Internship Programme provides interns with a framework under which experience is gained through practical work assignments while also being exposed to UNDP’s work. One of the most important advantages of being an intern is the close interaction with the supervisor and colleagues, and the opportunity to develop the skills required within a professional environment.   While remote internships will address Organization needs, especially in circumstances where in-person internships are not possible or opportune, supervisors and managers are required to ensure that additional attention and guidance be provided to enable the intern to make the most out of this experience.   To ensure the internship programme’s continuing success, the following key points when engaging an intern remotely must be considered.   Key points for Receiving Offices:  Visas will be not provided for remote internships; Remote interns are expected to provide their own equipment, internet and communication access and work space necessary to undertake the internship;  Ensure payment of the stipend at the remote stipend rate, in accordance with the policy; All interns need access to UNDP platforms, a corporate email, and virtual learning sessions;  Ensure that remote interns are added to office/team mailing lists and ensure they are invited to all staff meetings; and Remind supervisors to regularly check-in with the intern regarding the intern’s assignment.   Key points for supervisors:  Verify that the developed Terms of Reference are tailored to a remote assignment; it should be concise, concrete, and with a focus on the learning experience;  Establish and follow an onboarding plan; Establish strong channels of communication with the intern, considering that all meetings are virtual; Regular contact needs to be established between the supervisor and intern to check-in on the intern’s wellbeing, the progress of the work, and learning; Team meetings should be virtual or have the capacity to accommodate remote participants;  Invite the intern to all virtual team meetings and activities (formal and informal); Ensure that the intern is aware of all Organization/office updates related to special / crisis situations; and Remind the intern of UNDP’s Wellbeing resources.",
    "job-evaluation": "Job Evaluation   This policy presents the basic principles of job evaluation, the revised policy, detailed procedures, job evaluation tools and standards, including the use of generic job descriptions, reporting and oversight mechanisms, roles and responsibilities, templates and forms.    This supersedes Section 10205, Chapter II of the Personnel Manual 1995 Edition, Volume I - Locally Recruited Staff members; Chapter V of the Personnel Manual 1995 Edition, Volume II - Internationally Recruited Staff members and all circulars on the subject.  Job Evaluation is a mechanism for determining the grade level of each position in the organization, on the basis of clearly established criteria, and for ensuring that positions with the same level of responsibilities and accountabilities are graded at the same level. The job evaluation process also provides information about the nature and content of jobs, thereby facilitating other Human Resources Management processes.     Job Evaluation is an important part of Organizational Design. It begins with elaboration of the strategy. The strategy sets the organization’s direction. Based on the organization’s strategy, the main functions are determined and optimum business processes of the organization are engineered and mapped. Another component of the Organizational Design is structure, which comprises the organizational components, their relationships and hierarchy. It sets the shape and the frame of the organization. When the structure is created, it is populated with jobs. Job design determines the content of jobs, levels of responsibility and accountability, functions, main results expected and impact of the results, relationships between the position and other staff in and outside the organization, main competencies required and minimum recruitment requirements. When jobs are created, they should be evaluated and classified. Thus, job evaluation is not a “stand-alone” process, rather it is very closely connected with other components of Organizational Design. Each component of the Organizational Design supports the others and together they support the organization’s goals and objectives. Thus, job design and evaluation must take into consideration other components of Organizational Design.  The classification procedures and standards of UNDP are based on the systems developed by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) for classification of positions in the General Service and Professional and higher categories.     In 1989 UNDP started the process of decentralization of job evaluation and delegation of authority to resident representatives to classify positions. The delegation was initiated with (i) UNDP/ADM/89/69 (2 August 1989), which assigned pre-approved levels of classification for certain UNOPS General Service positions, (ii) UNDP/ADM/92/75 (7 October 1992), which delegated authority for classification of extra-budgetary General Service positions, (iii) UNDP/ADM/97/24 (18 April 1997), which delegated the authority to Resident Representatives to classify positions in the General Service and National Officer categories except for positions at ICS 7 (G-7), ICS 8 (NOA), ICS 11(NOD) levels.  All other positions are evaluated and graded by the Office of Human Resources (OHR).  Principles  7. The basic principles of the UNDP job evaluation system are:  The level of responsibility and accountability of the positions in question is the primary basis for determining the level of the position.  Every position should be supported by an up-to-date job description that clearly describes the content of jobs, levels of responsibility and accountability, functions, main results expected and impact of the results, relationships between the position and other staff in and outside the organization, main competencies required and minimum recruitment requirements.  All decisions regarding the classification of positions are taken by the Administrator or, by delegation, on his behalf.  All headquarters and international positions (Fixed-Term Appointments and Temporary Appointments) are evaluated and graded centrally by OHR.  All the General Service and National Officer categories in country offices and Regional Centres, except for positions at ICS 11 (NOD) level, are classified by Country Offices/Regional Centres.  The Resident Representative has the authority to approve classifications and can delegate classification authority to the Country Director, Deputy Resident Representative or Deputy Country Director.  If new or revised job descriptions in country offices coincide with the generic job descriptions provided in  UNDP Toolkit for Managing Change, Country Offices do not have to go through a classification process.  Re-classification required: A significant change in more than two functions in the new job description has taken place vis-à-vis the old job description even though the grade level remains the same. Significant changes must occur in the main functions and levels of accountability and responsibility of the position and not in the specific results expected or specific duties/tasks. All National Officer positions at ICS 11 (NOD) level, even if they coincide with generic job descriptions, are classified centrally by OHR.  Job Evaluation, Budgetary Process and Position Management    Job Evaluation processes are linked to budgets. When staffing needs for specific functions are translated into jobs and positions, and the grade levels of positions are determined by the job evaluation process, budget should be available to cover the staffing needs. To implement reclassification of positions, provisions in the budget must be made to accommodate upgrades. Since each position can be reclassified in conjunction with the budget, it requires a significant degree of forward planning. The number of the available positions approved by the Executive Board/headquarters should be considered.     Managers approving (re)classifications of positions or submitting classification requests to OHR are responsible and accountable for validation of the positions availability and adequate budget availability to cover the expenditures of the positions in question.    The Executive Board allows for changes in individual classified levels during the budget cycle taking into consideration counterbalancing of positions’ upgrading with downgrading on an organization-wide basis. However, in all cases of classification of positions to ICS 13 (D-1) level and higher, Executive Board approval will be required before the classification finding is formalized.

    "language-allowance": "Language Allowance      1. The language allowance (LA) is a monetary incentive meant to encourage staff members in the learning and use of the various official languages of the United Nations. The LA recognizes, through a cash payment, the proven ability to function, orally and in writing, in more than one official UN language.       Official UN Languages       There are six official languages in the United Nations, namely:       Arabic   Chinese   English    French   Russian   Spanish      All UNDP offices operate in one of these languages as the official UN working language of the duty station and, therefore, under the terms of their appointment, all staff members are required to be proficient in one official language.      Eligibility       All General Service (GS) staff members administered under the Fixed-Term Appointment of the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules are eligible for LA, provided that the qualifying conditions as set out in the paragraphs below have been met.       International Professional (IP) or National Professional Officers (NPOs) are not eligible for LA.       To qualify for the allowance, a General Service staff member must be proficient in two official UN languages and must pass a UN language proficiency examination (LPE) in at least one of them, subject to the following conditions:       A staff member whose mother tongue is an official UN language must pass the examination in another official UN language, which may be the language in which he/she is required to be proficient by the terms of his/her appointment; or       A staff member whose mother tongue is not an official UN language must pass the examination in an official UN language other than that in which he/she is required to be proficient by the terms of his/her appointment.       Staff members may qualify for up to two LAs. To receive a second LA, a staff member must be proficient in three official UN languages and must pass the UN LPE in two of them, subject to the following conditions:       A staff member whose mother tongue is an official UN language must pass the examination in another two official UN languages, one of which may be the language in which he/she is required to be proficient by the terms of his/her appointment; or       A staff member whose mother tongue is not an official UN language must pass the examination in two official UN languages other than that in which he/she is required to be proficient by the terms of his/her appointment.   Effective Date       The LA shall be paid to a staff member as of the first of the month following the month in which the staff member successfully passed the LPE. The UN Staff Development and  Learning Service will communicate the results of the LPE and establish the effective date.       Administration       9. The administration of LAs is completely decentralized to the respective bureau or office, which is responsible for raising the Personnel Action Form to record the staff member’s entitlement, processing payments, and maintenance of records.       Amount Payable       The amount of allowance payable at each duty station is specified in the local salary scale. The allowance is the equivalent of 5 percent of the annual total net remuneration of level GS-5 step 1 of the duty station at the time the allowance is first established. The amount is revised whenever there is a change in the GS salary scale.       The amount of the second LA is equivalent to half the amount of the first LA.       Salary Treatment       12. The LA is pensionable and is not subject to staff assessment. It is paid together with the salary in the local currency of the duty station.       Language Allowance Determination      13. The LA is taken into account in determining the following, where applicable:       Pensionable remuneration, contributions to, and benefits payable by the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), e.g., retirement benefit, surviving dependent(s) benefits   Compensation for service-incurred illness, injury, or death   Special post allowance (SPA)   Overtime compensation   Insurance premiums   Separation payments, e.g., commutation of annual leave, death benefit, termination indemnity, etc.   Grade and step on promotion from the GS to the NPO or IP category      UN Language Proficiency Examinations (LPE)       UN LPEs are given to confirm the written and spoken knowledge of the official languages of the UN and consequent eligibility for language-related incentives.       The UN LPE can be taken:      Upon completing the language course: All individuals who were admitted to participate in a UN language course are eligible to take the LPE after they have completed the highest level of that course. This is the only situation in which the LPE is open to those who are not staff members of the organizations of the UN system.      Upon documenting equivalent knowledge: Staff members who have not attended or completed a UN language course but can document an equivalent knowledge of the language in which they wish to be tested are eligible to take the LPE. Such equivalent knowledge may be demonstrated, for example, by language study outside the UN for at least two years or use of the language on a regular basis for school or work; and/or       Upon contractual validity: Staff members who have regular, fixed-term appointments or contracts of limited duration are eligible to take the LPE, provided that their contract expiration date is after the date of the examination for which they are applying. Those whose contracts expire before this date must obtain authorization from their head of office, as provided for on the UN LPE application form.       Administration of LPE       In New York, the Language and Communications Programme of the UN Staff Development and Learning Service administers the UN LPE.       Outside New York, the LPE is normally supervised by a senior internationally recruited official designated by the Resident Representative (RR) to act as Examinations Administrator whose responsibility is to administer the examination to all candidates within the UN community in the duty station area.       Registration       Candidates must complete and submit the UN LPE Application form to the local Examinations Administrator, as follows:       If stationed in New York, to the Language and Communications Programme in the UN Staff Development and Learning Service       If stationed outside New York, to the Examinations Administrator through the local Human Resources/Operations Manager      Registration Deadline: The deadline for receipt of applications is scheduled by the UN Staff Development and Learning Service. Late applications are not accepted.       If the local Examinations Administrator is not certain that applications will arrive by the deadline, the completed application form for each candidate must be faxed to the UN Staff Development and Learning Service at 001-212-963-9514. Faxed lists of candidates’ names in lieu of application forms will not be accepted. Even if the applications are faxed, the original application forms must be submitted in order for candidates to be officially registered. No examinations are pouched until the applications themselves are received.       Exam structure       21. The UN LPE consists of the following, both parts of which participants must pass in order to progress to the next level:       A written part, which is administered to all candidates at the same time and consists of a composition and a series of multiple-choice questions testing listening comprehension, reading, vocabulary, and grammar. The session lasts three hours and ten minutes.       An oral part, which consists of a 15-minutes interview conducted individually with each candidate.       Passing requirements       A minimum score of 65 percent in each part of the exam shall be required for a passing grade. If a candidate receives a score of 80 percent or more on the written part but fails the oral part, the jury adjudicating the exam shall review the case and may allow a candidate to retain his or her written score for the following exam session. In this event, the candidate shall receive written notification of the jury’s decision and will be required to apply to retake only the oral exam at the following session.       Candidates who receive 80 percent or more on the oral part but fail the written part and candidates who have taken only one part of the exam at one session, shall retake both parts at a subsequent session.       Exam schedule       LPEs are held not less than once each year.       The written examination is scheduled by the UN Staff Development and Learning Service. No deviation from the dates contained therein is allowed.       The scheduling of the oral interviews is to be determined by the local Examinations Administrator, but it is suggested that they be held before the written examination date so that all examination material is returned for correction as soon as possible after the written test has been administered.       Cost       The examination is at no cost to the staff member. UNDP NY reimburses the UN for the cost of the examination.       If the staff member is based outside the location of the Examination Centre, travel costs are covered by UNDP and are charged against the same funding source used to cover the staff member’s post. Such travel is considered as official duty travel (DT) and, therefore, his/her absence is not charged to annual leave (AL).         ",
    "last-day-pay-purposes": "Last Day for Pay Purposes    1.   The section below explains when payment of salary, allowances, and other entitlements cease upon separation of a staff member.  General     When a staff member is separated, payment of his/her salary, allowances, and other entitlements ceases as of the close of business (COB) on the effective date of separation, i.e.:     Resignation: either the date of expiration of the notice period or such other date that the Administrator or Head of Office/Bureau accepts    Expiration of a fixed-term appointment: the date specified in the letter of appointment    Termination: the date stated in the notice of termination    Dismissal: the date stated in the notice of separation    Summary dismissal: the date of dismissal decided by the Administrator    Retirement: the last day of the month when staff member reaches age 60, 62 or 65 or such later date that may be approved.     Death: the date of the staff member's death, except that:   No prorating is required for payment of education grant when a staff member dies while in service after the beginning of the school year and, in this case, the entitlement to education grant will continue for the duration of a school year that has begun; and   When there is a surviving spouse or dependent child, the date shall be determined in accordance with the following schedule:      Payment related to the period of extension beyond the date of death is made in a lump sum as soon as the pay accounts and related matters can be closed. Such payment shall be made only to the surviving spouse and dependent children.     If a staff member is separated from UNDP while on special leave without pay (SLWOP), the effective date of separation is the last day of active duty. However, with regard to participation in the United Nations Joint Pension Fund (UNJSPF), the effective date of separation for the purposes of benefits under the Fund is the date on which the staff member's last contribution to the UNJSPF was credited to the Fund. The separation payments are calculated at the salary rates effective at the time of separation.     When an international staff member exercises an entitlement to return travel, the last day for pay purposes is either the date established under the first paragraph above or the estimated date of arrival at the place of entitlement, whichever is later. The estimated date of arrival is based on the approved travel time calculated as necessary to go from the duty station to the place of entitlement, the travel commencing no later than the date following the one established under the first paragraph above.    Sick Leave    In the case of expiration of a fixed-term appointment or of a termination, the date of separation may be postponed if the staff member is on certified sick leave (SL) at the time of separation to enable the staff member to use any SL entitlement. If the staff member has exhausted his/her SL entitlement, the date is postponed until the end of the certified SL.     When an appointment is extended solely to enable a staff member to use his/her SL entitlement, such extension will not give rise to any further entitlement to salary increment, AL, SL, or home leave (HL), but credit towards repatriation grant (RG) may continue to accrue if the staff member has not returned to his/her home country. In the event of death during the period of extension, the period prior to the staff member’s death may be taken into account in the determination of the death benefit.     Maternity Leave    In the case of an expiration of a fixed-term appointment or of a termination, the date of separation may be postponed if the staff member is on maternity leave (ML) at the time of separation to enable the staff member to use any SL entitlement. If the staff member has exhausted his/her ML entitlement, the date is postponed until the end of the ML.     When an appointment is extended solely to enable a staff member to use his/her ML entitlement, such extension will not give rise to any further entitlement to salary increment, AL, SL or HL, but credit towards RG may continue to accrue if the staff member has not returned to his/her home country. In the event of death during the period of extension, the period prior to the staff member’s death may be taken into account in the determination of the death benefit. ",
    "malicious-acts-insurance-policy-maip": "Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP)      The purpose of the Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP) – formerly known as the War Risk Insurance Plan – is to cover eligible individuals worldwide for death or disability caused by a malicious act.      The MAIP is administered by the United Nations Department of Safety & Security (DSS), through Willis UK Limited of London, a broker representing the Underwriters, Lloyd’s of London.       All staff and Individual subscribers covered by the Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP) must comply with all security directives. Failure to comply with such security directives is grounds for termination. Staff and Non-Staff alike are required to be aware of security directives, including issuance of security clearance for travel and completion of the Field Security course. MAIP is an example of interagency cooperation and is based on adherence of all UN Organizations to common security guidelines and procedures. The programme takes advantage of economies of scale, market leverage, and synergies in organizations’ operations and risk in order to achieve overall cost efficiencies.      Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP)   MAIP Annex A - Continental Scale       UNDP is one of the UN agencies that subscribe to the MAIP programme. As such, it is required to provide updated underwriting census information annually to the UN in order to renew this policy. The total policy cost and billing of participants is based upon the number and location (designated countries, non-designated countries, or HQ countries) of staff and/or other individuals eligible for compensation.      The UN sends a renewal circular to the Office of Human Resources (OHR) at UNDP, requesting workforce information. OHR compiles and electronically sends relevant data on all staff as well as non-staff to the UN.      Eligibility      The following individuals are automatically covered by the MAIP:    Internationally recruited staff members administered under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules   Locally recruited staff members, both General Service (GS) staff and National Professional Officers (NPOs), administered under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules   Internationally recruited consultants   Locally recruited consultants   Locally recruited service contract holders   Official visitors (determined by their travel/DSA status)      MAIP is not extended to spouses or dependant children.      Coverage      8. Under MAIP, the individuals mentioned in the paragraph above are covered on a 24hour basis for accidents resulting in death or disability caused by:   War    Invasion   Hostilities   Acts of foreign enemies, whether war be declared or not   Civil war   Revolution    Rebellion   Insurrection   Military or usurped power   Riots or civil commotion   Sabotage   Explosion of war weapons   Terrorist activities      Exclusions      The MAIP does not cover death or dismemberment directly or indirectly resulting from or consequent upon the insured person:    Engaging in or taking part in UN naval, military, or air force service or operations    Using a firearm, unless he/she is authorized, in writing, by the UN Security   Service to carry arms   Using, as a passenger, a military aircraft as mode of transportation, except in disaster and emergency situations, where no other means of transport is available   Being under the influence of alcohol or drugs    Engaging in air travel, except as a passenger   Committing suicide or attempted suicide or intentional self-injury    Being in a state of insanity   Initiating the criminal act   Deliberately exposing him/herself to exceptional danger (except in an attempt to save human life)      This policy does not cover:   Deliberate exposure to exceptional danger (except in an attempt to save human life) or the insured person's own criminal act, or willful or reckless misconduct   The insured person's negligent or blatant disregard or breach of UN/UNDP security guidelines or procedures   Loss consequent on war, whether declared or not, between any of the following countries namely China, France, the UK, the Russian Federation and USA   Loss consequent on war in Europe, whether declared or not, other than civil war, any enforcement action by or on behalf of the UN in which any of the countries stated in c) above or any armed forces thereof are engaged   Any claim(s) in any way caused or contributed to by an act of terrorism involving the use or release or the threat thereof of any nuclear weapon or device or chemical or biological agent    Disablement in any way caused or contributed to by: neuroses, psychoneuroses, psychopathies or psychoses, anxiety, stress, fatigue, or mental or emotional diseases or disorders of any type      If an insured person loses his/her life while transporting for the Organization large amounts of cash in areas where banking facilities are not available, it is extremely unlikely that the claim will be covered under this policy since it would be considered as “deliberate exposure to exceptional danger.”       Limitations      Maximum per event      12. The policy has a maximum limit of of $50,000,000 on any one event. This means that the Underwriters will only cover claims of up to $50,000,000 for any one event, which is defined as all individual losses arising out of or directly occasioned by one specific event occurring at an identifiable time and place; however, the duration and extent of any \"event\" so defined shall be limited to 24 consecutive hours and within a 10-mile radius. Any individual loss that occurs outside such a period and/or radius will not be included in that defined \"event\".      Air travel      13. This policy covers only up to 30 passengers on any one aircraft and, therefore, there should not be more than 30 passengers from the UN system travelling on any aircraft unless this has been brought to the prior attention of the Underwriters through DSS.      Benefits       14. There are three benefits under MAIP:    Death   Permanent total disablement   Permanent partial disablement      Death Benefit      The benefit under MAIP for death is as follows:    US$500,000 for:    Internationally recruited professional staff members governed under the  UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules   Official visitors    Internationally recruited consultants; and       Ten times the net annual salary (all additional allowances, e.g., spouse and child benefits and language allowance, are excluded in the calculations), subject to a maximum of US$500,000 for:    Locally recruited staff members governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules   Locally recruited consultants   Locally recruited service contract holders      Should an insured person, while covered under MAIP, disappear, and his/her body not be found within 12 months after his/her disappearance and sufficient evidence is produced satisfactory to the Underwriters that leads them inevitably to the conclusion that he/she sustained malicious bodily injury and that such injury caused his/her death, the Underwriters will pay the death benefit under MAIP provided that the person or persons to whom such sum is paid sign(s) an agreement to refund such sum to the Underwriters if the insured person is subsequently found to be living.      Permanent total disablement benefit      Permanent Total Disablement means disablement that entirely prevents the insured person from attending to any business or occupation of any and every kind, that lasts 12 months, and that, at the expiry of that period, is beyond hope of improvement. In no case will the Underwriters be liable to pay compensation unless the medical advisor(s) whom they appoint is/are allowed, so often as deemed necessary, to make an examination of the insured person.      The benefit under MAIP for permanent total disablement and dismemberment is as follows:       US$500,000 as per items 1 to 5 of the continental scale found in Annex A above for:    Internationally recruited professional staff members governed under the  UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules   Official visitors    Internationally recruited consultants; and     Ten times the net annual salary (all additional allowances, e.g. spouse and child benefits, language allowance, are excluded in the calculations), subject to a maximum of US$500,000 as per items 1 to 5 of the continental scale found in Annex A for:    Locally recruited staff members governed under the UN Staff   Regulations and Staff Rules   Locally recruited consultants    Locally recruited service contract holders      If, as a consequence of an accident, any physical disability or condition of the insured person that existed before the accident occurred is aggravated, the amount of any compensation payable under this insurance in respect of the consequences of the accident shall be the amount that is reasonably considered to have been payable if such consequences had not been so aggravated.   Permanent partial disablement benefit      Permanent Partial Disablement means disablement that prevents the insured person from attending to a substantial part of his or her business or occupation, that lasts 12 calendar months, and that, at the expiry of that period, is beyond hope of improvement. In no case will the Underwriters be liable to pay compensation unless the medical advisor(s) whom they appoint is/are allowed, so often as deemed necessary, to make an examination of the insured person.      The benefit under MAIP for permanent partial disablement is as follows:       A percentage of US$ 500,000 as per items 6 to 42 of the continental scale found in Annex A for:    Internationally recruited professional staff members governed    under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules   Official visitors   Internationally recruited consultants       A percentage of 10 times the net annual salary (all additional allowances, e.g., spouse and child benefits and language allowance, are excluded in the calculations), subject to a maximum of US$500,000 as per items 6 to 42 of the continental scale found in Annex A for:    Locally recruited staff members governed under the UN Staff   Regulations and Staff Rules   Locally recruited consultants   Locally recruited service contract holders  Beneficiaries       In the case of death, the benefit payable is for the beneficiaries designated by the:   Staff member:  on Form P-2 Designation, Change or Revocation of Beneficiary Consultant:  on Form Designation, Change, or Revocation of Beneficiary – Consultant.  ",
    "mandatory-age-separation": "Mandatory Age of Separation (Retirement)           In accordance with Staff Regulation 9.2, the age for mandatory separation in UNDP is age 60 for staff members that are recruited before 1 January 1990; age 62 for staff members that are recruited on or after 1 January 1990 and age 65 for staff members that are recruited on or after 1 January, 2014.    In accordance with the UN Staff Rule 9.5, retirement under article 28 of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF) Regulations shall not be regarded as a termination within the meaning of the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.  Early Retirement  Between the age of 55 and the age of mandatory separation, a staff member may take early retirement, if he or she has at least five years of contributory service in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF).  Depending on the age and the number of years of service, the pension benefits are reduced in the case of early retirement.  These and other options are described fully in the Regulations and Rules of the UNJSPF.       The above provisions mean that a staff member  will separate from the Organization upon the mandatory age of separaton specified in Paragraph 1, above.      Effective Date of separation          The effective date of separation for a staff member that reaches his or her mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement is the last day of the month in which the staff member reaches age 60, 62, or 65 as appropriate. However, at the request of the staff member, he or she may be separated on the day he or she reaches age 60, 62 or 65.       Extension beyond Mandatory Age of Separation   Retention in service beyond the mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement of  internationally and locally recruited staff members governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules is an exception to the provisions of UN Staff Regulation 9.2 and may only be approved when it is in the interest of UNDP.  Criteria and conditions for  retention beyond the mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement     A retention beyond the mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement is considered highly exceptional and must be substantiated by the  following principles:   Critical organizational commitments:  When critical organizational commitments, directly affecting institutional credibility, and the delivery of major financial obligations would be jeopardized by a staff member’s departure through retirement.    Staff safety:  When the safety of staff and security of UNDP premises and/or continuity of UNDP’s presence and operations in a country are jeopardized through unexpected crises such as natural disasters, civil strife or war, and these threats would be ameliorated by the continuing service of a staff member beyond his or her normal age of retirement.    Disruption of operations due to unavoidable delay:  When a properly planned replacement for a retiree is unavoidably delayed and the departure of the retiring staff member would cause significant disruptions to operations, delivery, representation or the safety and well-being of staff members.  Critical need for expertise: When the need for a particular staff member’s expertise can be clearly demonstrated and reasonable efforts to obtain that expertise elsewhere have been exhausted.    Employment and retention beyond the mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement of staff members under Temporary Appointments          Staff members may be employed, engaged or retained beyond the mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement in accordance with the Temporary Appointment   Period of retention beyond the mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement     No change will be made to the mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement of a staff member who is retained in service beyond his or her mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement.        In order to facilitate the separation of a staff member upon reaching their mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement, six months before he or she reaches age 60, 62 or 65, a letter with all the administrative procedures shall be sent to:    Local staff members stationed outside NY, by the local HR/Operations Manager;     Local staff members stationed in NY, by the OHR Copenhagen HR Associate serving the duty station;     International professional staff members, by the OHR Copenhagen HR Associate serving the duty station.            Restrictions concerning former staff members in receipt of a pension benefit  Employment of former staff members who are in receipt of a pension benefit from the UNJSPF shall be subject to the following restrictions:  Former staff members may not receive compensation of more than US$ 50,000 for up to six months of employment or engagement, without suspension of his or her UNJSPF retirement benefit.  In all cases, former staff members may not be re-employed at a level higher than that at which they separated from the organization, or higher than the level at which regular staff members are remunerated for the same function at the same duty station.   Approving Authority           In those few cases when the extension of a staff member's service beyond the mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement is needed, requests are reviewed and approved by:       Head of Office: Locally recruited staff members stationed outside New York, for six months or less;  Director, OHR: Locally recruited staff members stationed in New York and international professional staff members up to the D1/P6 level,  for six months or less;  Associate Administrator:  i) All staff members up to the D1/P6 level for any extension beyond six months, based on the review and recommendation of the Director, OHR; and ii) International professional staff members at the D-2/P7 level,for any period, based on the review and recommendation of the Director, OHR.      Decisions to retain staff members at the Assistant Secretary-General level (ASG) and above in the interest of UNDP shall be made by the Secretary-General (SG).          In cases when an extension beyond the mandatory age of separation/normal age of retirement is approved, the staff member will continue to be a participant in the UNJSPF until his or her separation from service.     .

    "medical-evacuation-travel-met": "Medical Evacuation Travel   The purpose of Medical Evacuation Travel (MET) is to allow staff members and eligible dependents the opportunity to secure essential medical care or treatment for a severe illness or injury requiring medical intervention which is locally unavailable or inadequate.   The following definitions apply in this policy:  Country of Home leave: place of staff member’s recruitment or nationality Dependent: spouse or children covered under the medical insurance plan Destination: recognized regional medical centre Evacuee: the staff member or dependent authorized to undertake MET  Family member escort: a family member authorized to travel with the evacuee under the special circumstances  Medical escort: a physician or a nurse authorized to escort the evacuee when medical attention is required during travel  Recognized regional medical centre: regional facilities designated by the UN Medical Director in different parts of the world for medical evacuations from countries with inadequate medical facilities (see Annex B)   Eligibility of Internationally Recruited Staff Members   Internationally recruited staff members governed under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, their spouses and dependent children residing at the duty station may be evacuated in case of an acute illness or injury for the purpose of securing essential medical care or treatment which cannot be secured locally because of inadequate medical facilities. Internationally recruited staff members, their spouses and dependent children should plan all elective surgical, medical or dental procedures in conjunction with their home leave (HL) or family visit (FV) travel.   Locally Recruited Staff Members   Locally recruited staff members governed under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, their spouses and dependent children for whom the Organization has not assumed a responsibility for relocation to or from the duty station will normally be expected to use the facilities available locally. However, if an acute life-threatening medical emergency occurs, MET will be considered when the available local facilities offer an inadequate response.  Former Staff Members    Former staff members, including retirees, are not eligible for MET.   Escorts  \t Medical escort   A physician or a nurse may be authorized to escort the evacuee only when medical attention is required during travel.   Family member escort   A family member is authorized to travel with the evacuee under the following circumstances:  a) \tin psychiatric cases;  b) \tfor children up to 18 years of age; and/or  c) \tfor evacuees who cannot look after themselves (e.g. stretcher or paralytic cases).   Donor   A donor may be authorized to accompany the evacuee. If required, this person may also act as an escort as per the above paragraph.   Destination   Recognized regional medical centre   The UN Medical Director has designated regional medical facilities in different parts of the world for medical evacuations from countries with inadequate medical facilities. The current list of these centres is provided in Annex B. The UN Medical Director may revise this list whenever the need arises, and OHR will keep Country Offices regularly informed about any changes. MET is normally authorized to the nearest recognized regional medical centre. If difficulties arise in obtaining an entry visa in the receiving country, an alternative destination within the region is authorized.   Country of Home Leave \t  In the case of internationally recruited staff members, MET may be authorized to the country of Home Leave (HL) in cases of:  a) \thigh-risk pregnancies;  b) \tpsychiatric conditions; or  c) \tillnesses requiring a long period of convalescence.   Place of staff member’s choice    If there are valid reasons, a patient may be evacuated to:  a) \tThe country of HL (if the case is not covered under the above paragraph); or  b) \tAny country of the staff member’s choice. The staff member is required to produce satisfactory medical evidence of proper medical care or treatment received at the place chosen.   Emergency Medical Evacuation  Emergency medical evacuations by definition are unpredictable and must be executed accurately and quickly, in the best interest of the staff member (and/or eligible dependant) and within the cost restrictions described below. Therefore, given the emergency needs of staff, the significant cost to the Organization, and the fact that emergency evacuations often occur outside normal working hours, all staff should be periodically briefed on emergency medical evacuation procedures, and responsible officers should have the most updated contact numbers for staff, regional medical centres, ambulance services, medical officers, International SOS and OHR HQ. The Resident Representative determines the place of evacuation, which should normally be the nearest place with adequate facilities for the treatment authorized (among those listed in Annex B, or a closer location if adequate services are available).   Costs  Recognized regional medical centre   The Organization will bear the travel costs for the evacuee, any authorized escort and donor.   Country of home leave   The Organization will bear the travel costs in the cases mentioned in the paragraph ‘Country of Home Leave’ above for the evacuee, any authorized escort and donor.   Place of the staff member’s choice   When travel is to the staff member’s country of HL, advance HL or FV is recommended and may be authorized. However, if the staff member has already exhausted his/her HL or FV entitlement, MET may be authorized to the place of HL, but UNDP will only pay whichever of the following two costs is lower, and the staff member will be responsible for any difference:   a) \tFrom the duty station to the staff member’s officially recognized HL place and back to the duty station; and   b) \tFrom the duty station to the place where MET is exercised and back to the duty station.   When travel is authorized to any other country of the staff member’s choice, UNDP will only pay whichever of the following two costs is lower, and the staff member will be responsible for any difference:  a) \tFrom the duty station to the place of the staff member’s choice and back to the duty station; and   b) \tFrom the duty station to the place where MET is recommended and back to the duty station.   Length   The period spent on MET should normally not exceed 45 days. When MET is expected to exceed 45 days, or for any extension of MET beyond 45 days, authorization must be obtained from the UN Medical Director. For this purpose, all relevant medical documentation must be forwarded to the UN Medical Director.   Once authorized initially, normally not more than one follow-up MET will be approved for the same condition. Also, normally only one follow-up MET will be approved for surgical procedures.   Children Born while Mother is on Medical Evacuation Travel  When a child is born while the mother is on MET, UNDP will pay, in respect of the newborn child, whichever of the following two costs is lower:   a) \tTravel from the place where MET is recommended to the duty station; and   b) \tTravel from the place where the mother exercised MET to the duty station.   Repatriation of Mortal Remains  In the unfortunate event of the patient’s death while on MET, UNDP will cover the costs of transportation from the place of death:   a) \tIf an internationally recruited staff member, to:   i) \this/her place of HL; or   ii) \tany other place designated by his/her family, provided that the family pays any expenses in excess of the cost of transportation from the duty station/place of death to his/her place of HL;   b) \tIf an internationally recruited staff member’s spouse or dependent child, to:   i) \tthe staff member’s place of HL; or   ii) \tany other place designated by the staff member provided he/she will pay any expenses in excess of the cost of transportation from the duty station/place of death to his/her place of HL;   c) \tIf a locally recruited staff member, to the duty station; and  d) \tIf a locally recruited staff member’s spouse or dependent child, to the duty station.   Mode of Transportation   Commercial air transportation by the most direct and economical route is the normal mode for MET.   Flight Class  The flight class for MET for:   Staff members at the Under-Secretary General (USG) and Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) levels will be, irrespective of the duration of the flight, in the class immediately below first class;   Staff at the Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) level are entitled to the class immediately below First Class regardless of flight duration with the exception of journeys of four hours or less within the same continent (this excludes overnight travel, where the traveler must work upon arrival);   All other staff members will be, irrespective of the duration of the flight, in economy class. The class immediately below first class may be authorized by the Head of Office, when medically recommended. (The local Operations Manager must check with the local Medical Officer of the Regional Commission; the UN Dispensary Physician; or the local UN Examining Physician); and  The duty travel website has additional information on allowances and expenses as well as flight duration, travel time, authorized rest periods and stopovers, and travel by train, by sea or by automobile.   Daily Subsistence Allowance   When MET is authorized to the nearest recognized regional medical centre which is not the staff member’s place of HL, a Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) may be paid.  DSA is only paid upon arrival at the recognized medical center or any other approved destination for medical evacuation.  DSA is not paid for the day on which MET is concluded or for overnight MET on a plane.  DSA is not paid upon the return of the staff member and his or her authorized family member escort at the duty station upon conclusion of MET.  DSA is applicable  up to a maximum of 45 days as follows:   a) \tFor the evacuee when not hospitalized, 100 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable to the authorized place of evacuation;   b) \tFor the evacuee when hospitalized, one third of the standard DSA rate applicable to the authorized place of evacuation;   c) \tFor the family member escort authorized to accompany the evacuee:   i) \tif the patient is not hospitalized, 50 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable to the authorized place of evacuation; and   ii)\tif the patient is hospitalized, 100 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable to the authorized place of evacuation;   d) \tFor the medical escort authorized to accompany the evacuee, 100 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable to the authorized place of evacuation, but limited to two to three days depending on travel time; and   e) \tFor the donor, no DSA is paid unless he/she is also acting as a family escort.   When MET is authorized to the staff member’s place of HL in the cases mentioned in the paragraph under ‘Destination’ above, actual expenses for hotel or other accommodation may be reimbursed on the basis of receipts:   a) \tFor the evacuee when not hospitalized, 50 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable to the staff member’s HL place;   b) \tFor the evacuee when hospitalized, no DSA is paid;   c) \tFor the family member authorized to accompany the evacuee:   i) \tif the patient is not hospitalized, 25 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable to the staff member’s HL place; and   ii) \tif the patient is hospitalized, 50 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable to the staff member’s HL place.   d) \tFor the medical escort authorized to accompany the evacuee, 100 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable to the authorized place of evacuation is paid, but limited to two to three days depending on travel time.   Up-to-date DSA rates can be found on the ICSC website.   Place of Staff Member’s Choice   When advance HL or FV is authorized instead of MET, no DSA is paid, except for the medical escort. The medical escort receives 100 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable to the place of evacuation, but limited to two to three days depending on travel time.   Place of Home Leave  When MET is authorized to the place of HL in cases not mentioned in the paragraph ‘Country of Home Leave’ above. The two paragraphs under ‘Place of Home Leave’ above also apply.   When MET is authorized to the place of the staff member’s choice which is not the staff member’s place of HL, DSA may be paid up to 45 days as follows:  a) \tFor the evacuee when not hospitalized, 100 percent of whichever of the following two costs is lower:   i) \tthe standard DSA rate applicable at the place of the staff member’s choice; or   ii) \tthe standard DSA rate applicable at the place where MET is recommended;    b) \tFor the evacuee when hospitalized, one third of whichever of the following two costs is lower:   i) \tthe standard DSA rate applicable at the place of the staff member’s choice; or   ii) \tthe standard DSA rate applicable at the place where MET is recommended;   c) \tFor the family member escort authorized to accompany the evacuee,   i) \tif the patient is not hospitalized, 50 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable at the place of the staff member’s choice or where MET is recommended, whichever is lower; or   ii) \tif the patient is hospitalized, 100 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable at the place of the staff member’s choice or where MET is recommended, whichever is lower;   d) \tFor the medical escort authorized to accompany the evacuee, 100 percent of the standard DSA rate applicable to the authorized place of evacuation, but limited to two to three days depending on travel time; and   e) \tFor the donor, no DSA is paid unless he/she is also acting as a family escort.   Terminal Expenses and Other Expenses   Terminal expenses   The amount of terminal expenses for each leg of the trip to and from the air terminal will be:   Travel – Official business travel, allowances and expenses  a) \tWhen no UN/UNDP vehicle is made available:   i) \tUS$38 for the evacuee (US$63 for New York);  ii) \tUS$38 for the medical escort; and  iii) \tUS$11 for the family member authorized to accompany the evacuee at UNDP’s expense (US$21 for New York); and   b) \tWhen a UN/UNDP vehicle is made available or the office arranges for transportation at the organization’s expense:   i) \tUS$11 for the evacuee;  ii) \tUS$11 for the medical escort; and  iii) \tUS$6 for the family member authorized to accompany the evacuee at UNDP’s expense.

    "medical-insurance-medical-insurance-plan-mip": "Medical Insurance: Medical Insurance Plan (MIP)      The Medical Insurance Plan (MIP) is a health insurance scheme operated by the UN and related organizations, e.g., the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the benefit of locally recruited active staff members (in the General Service and National Officer categories) and former staff members (and their eligible family members) serving or residing at designated duty stations away from headquarters. The plan was established in 1987 by the General Assembly (GA) at its 41st session in accordance with UN Staff Regulation 6.2 and replaced the Medical Expense Assistance Plan (MEAP).      The object of the MIP is to assist subscribers and their eligible family members in meeting expenses incurred for certain health services, facilities, and supplies that arise from sickness, accident, or maternity and that should be reimbursed within the limits laid down in UNDP MIP Rules.      To ensure optimum efficiency and confidentiality, UNDP contracts the services of an external service provider for the professional administration of medical claims.  The service provider administers the MIP on behalf of UNDP in accordance with UNDP rules and procedures.      Audience      The MIP is targeted at the following entities and persons:   UNDP Country Offices   UNDP locally recruited staff members governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules and stationed outside NY HQ   UN system MIP subscribers administered by UNDP      The policies detailed in the Policies and Procedures relate to a staff member’s enrollment, status, and eligibility.

    "medical-insurance-un-ny-aetna-medical-insurance": "Aetna Group Life Insurance Plan   A group life insurance plan (“plan” or “GLIP”) is offered to staff of the United Nations Secretariat, funds, and programmes, providing term insurance coverage against death and disability. The underwriter of the plan is the Aetna Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut, United States of America (“insurance company” or “Aetna”). The policyholder is the UN.   Except for Junior Professional Officers (JPOs – donor governments fully subsidize the contributions of participating JPOs), this plan is financed solely from the contributions of participating staff without any subsidy from the Organization. The plan provides term insurance coverage only and has no cash value at the time of withdrawal. Eligibility   The Group Life Insurance Plan (GLIP) is available to all internationally and locally recruited staff members worldwide governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules who have an appointment of six months or longer and who have been medically cleared upon appointment.   Except for JPOs, participation in the plan is voluntary and staff may withdraw at any time. For JPOs, participation in the plan is compulsory.   Participation in the plan is open and automatic for those who apply within 60 days of signing the qualifying letter of appointment.   Those who apply after 60 days are required, at the time of application, to provide evidence of insurability satisfactory to Aetna, which reserves the right to reject the application or require the applicant to undergo a medical examination at the applicant’s expense. In such cases, coverage will begin only after Aetna gives its written consent.  Coverage Insurance coverage level   The amount of life insurance coverage that can be purchased is as follows:   Normally based on three times the participant’s pensionable remuneration, subject to a maximum amount of US$300,000  For those enrolling at age 62, coverage is limited to US$20,000  Maximum coverage for staff still in service at age 62 is US$150,000. If coverage was higher beforehand, it will be reduced upon reaching 62.  Life Insurance benefits   The life insurance coverage consists of a principal sum payable, in the event of death from any cause, to the designated beneficiary(ies) and equivalent to the full amount for which the participant was insured at the time of his/her death.  Accidental death and dismemberment benefits  The accidental death coverage consists of an additional sum payable, in the event of accidental loss of life, to the designated beneficiary(ies) and equivalent to the full amount for which the participant was insured at the time of his/her death.  The accidental dismemberment coverage consists of:  The full amount for which the participant was insured will be paid for accidental loss of:   Both hands (by severance through or above the wrist joint) Both feet (by severance through or above the wrist and ankle joint)  One hand and one foot (by severance through or above the wrist or ankle joint) One hand and the sight of one eye One foot and the sight of one eye or  The sight of both eyes; or   Half the amount for which the participant was insured will be paid for the accidental loss of:  One hand One foot or  The sight of one eye  Benefits are payable under the accidental death and dismemberment coverage only if the loss:   Results directly and solely from an injury caused by an accident that is not excluded in the limitations of the paragraph immediately below and   Occurs within 90 days of the accident that causes the injury to the participant while insured  Benefits will also be payable if the loss is:  Caused by a pus-forming infection resulting directly and solely from an injury that is covered under the plan or  Caused by a surgical operation that is   Needed solely because of an injury that is covered under the plan and  Performed within 90 days after the injury occurs Accidental death and dismemberment exclusions  Under the accidental death and dismemberment plan, coverage will not apply for the following conditions:  Bodily or mental infirmity Disease, ptomaine or bacterial infections, of any kind Medical or surgical treatment Suicide or attempted suicide (sane or insane) Intentionally self-inflicted injury War or any act of war (declared or undeclared)  Aetna has consistently interpreted the war exclusion as applying to actions by a sovereign state or government against another.  Terrorism is characterized as premeditated violence for a political purpose by a person or group other than a government or state.  Aetna, therefore, does NOT exclude terrorist acts from coverage. Accelerated Death Benefit   Effective 1 October 2002, a new benefit called the Accelerated Death Benefit (ADB) is added to the GLIP.  In essence, this optional benefit provides for the payment, to the participant, of a portion of his/her life insurance after he/she has been diagnosed as terminally ill, leaving the balance of the life insurance for the benefit of designated beneficiaries after the death of the insured.  Under this arrangement, the cost of the benefit acceleration is recovered by discounting the ADB payment to the insured applicant.  To be considered terminally ill, the applicant must:  Be diagnosed as suffering from an incurable, progressive, and medically   recognized disease or condition  To a reasonable medical probability and on the basis of generally accepted medical protocols, have a life expectancy of no more than 12 months beyond the date of the application for an ADB  The ADB benefit:  Is available to all group life insurance participants (active staff, retirees and those separated for medical reasons)  May be requested at any time;  Is not available, if by assignment or otherwise, someone other than the insured is the owner of the life insurance coverage  May only be requested once under this plan.  The minimum amount that may be requested is US$5,000.  Applicants for an ADB should contact the UN Health and Life Insurance Section in the first instance.  They will then be provided with a package comprising an application form, a request-for-medical-documentation letter, authorizations for the release of medical information, and an ADB disclosure statement.  In considering a request for an ADB, Aetna may require the participant to submit, at Aetna’s expense, to an independent medical examination initiated by a physician chosen by Aetna.  Review of a request for an ADB will be suspended until the examination has been completed and the results submitted to Aetna.  When a participant elects the ADB option, the arrangement will work as follows.  First, a gross ADB payment is determined.  This amount will be based on a benefit of 50 percent of the amount of life insurance in force on the election date, taking into account any age reduction due to occur during the terminal illness qualifying period.  The appropriate discount will then be deducted from the gross ADB payment to arrive at the net amount actually payable to the insured.  Discounts will reflect the interest rate structure described in the paragraph below.  The remaining amount of life insurance carried in force, after the ADB payment is made, will be the original amount less the gross (before interest discount) ADB payment.  The interest rate used to calculate discounts will be the current yield on the 90-day United States Treasury bill on the date the ADB payment is issued.  The period used to calculate this charge will begin on the date the ADB is paid and will always be equal to the 12 months’ terminal illness qualifying period, regardless of the actual or expected date of death.  Upon approval by Aetna, the amount of the ADB will be paid in a lump sum.  To the extent allowed by law:  An ADB payment is exempt from any legal or equitable process for the debts of the insured  There can be no requirement to request an ADB in order to satisfy claims of creditors  Aetna cannot furnish legal or tax advice to the applicant or to the Organization.  Legal counsel and/or a tax adviser should be consulted before a request for an ADB is made. Enrollment and premiums  Application for insurance  Within the first 60 days of eligibility, JPOs and staff members who wish to participate in the GLIP should complete an application form and send it to:   For international and local staff stationed in New York, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the organizational unit, for forwarding to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section (see Claims section)  For international staff stationed outside New York, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the duty station for forwarding to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section  For local staff stationed outside New York, the Human Resources/ Operations Manager at the duty station concerned. The forms are kept locally and do not need to be forwarded to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section.  After the first 60 days of eligibility, staff members who wish to participate in the GLIP should complete the following documentation:  An application form An evidence of insurability form   Completed documentation should be sent to:   If an international or local staff member stationed in New York, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the organizational unit, who will forward it to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section for processing before Aetna  If an international staff member stationed outside New York, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the duty station, who will forward it to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section for processing before Aetna  If a local staff member stationed outside New York, the Human Resources/Operations Manager at the duty station concerned, who will forward the Evidence of Insurability Form only to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section for processing before Aetna.  The other forms are kept locally and do not need to be forwarded to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section. Effective date  Staff members who apply within the first 60 days of eligibility will be covered from the effective date of the letter of appointment.    Staff members who apply after the first 60 days of eligibility and who are required to file evidence of insurability will, if accepted, be covered from the date on which Aetna gives its written consent.  Premium  Before 1 October 2002, life insurance levels were set out in a schedule that related coverage amounts to ranges of pensionable remuneration, denominated in US dollars.  The coverage amount corresponded to 2.5 times the pensionable remuneration figure at the top of each bracket.    As of 1 October 2002, a staff member’s life insurance entitlement is directly linked to his/her pensionable remuneration and will be defined in terms of the related currency.  Under the new system, whenever pensionable remuneration increases, the life insurance amount will increase proportionately also, without regard to any fixed schedule of pensionable remuneration brackets.  As a result, it is now possible to state the required premium contribution as a percentage of pensionable remuneration.   Rate   The current premium rate is US$0.30 per US$1,000 coverage, which is equivalent to 0.09 percent of pensionable remuneration. Thus, if the level of pensionable remuneration of a participant is US$35,789, the corresponding level of life insurance coverage is three times that figure, i.e., US$107,367.  The corresponding monthly premium payment based on 0.09 percent of pensionable remuneration would be US$32.21.  In the case of the maximum coverage amount of US$300,000, the maximum monthly premium payment will be US$90.  The premium rate is determined by Aetna in consultation with the UN.  OHR will keep all offices regularly informed about any changes to the annual premiums.  Payment  The premium is paid in full by the staff member.   No subsidy is paid by the Organization.  The monthly premium is payable in US dollars in advance at the beginning of each month and is effected by means of automatic payroll deduction.  Two months’ premium will be deducted at the end of the first month of participation with no deduction made for the last month of service.   The premium for staff who are paid in currencies other than US dollars is based on their pensionable remuneration in the local currency and is then converted to US dollars, using the UN official rate of exchange, and remitted to the insurance company in US dollars.  Benefits payable by the insurance company will be the equivalent in US dollars, converted at the UN official rate of exchange at the time of payment, of the entitlement of the participant in local currency.  Records  The country office must maintain a record of the amounts collected for locally recruited staff members, should there be any questions or audit at a later date.   Automatic adjustment of coverage level and premium  The level of coverage and the corresponding premium will automatically be adjusted whenever an increase in pensionable remuneration occurs, unless:  The pensionable remuneration of the staff member already entitles him/her to the maximum coverage available; or   The staff member has executed a waiver of automatic increase prior to 1 January 2001.  A participant who does not wish to accept the increased life insurance coverage resulting from changes in his/her pensionable remuneration must cancel his/her coverage under the plan.  In order to reinstate life insurance participation at a future date, a new application must be made through the “evidence of insurability” process. Discontinuance of waiver of premium increase  In the past, staff were given an opportunity to waive the increase, thereby freezing life insurance coverage at the prior level.  With effect from 1 January 2001, the option to waive the coverage increase was discontinued. The life insurance level of staff that executed a waiver of automatic increase prior to 1 January 2001 will be maintained at the lower coverage level. Reapplication after cancellation of coverage  A staff member who has cancelled coverage may re-apply at a later date for coverage based on his/her pensionable remuneration at that time.  Enrollment in the plan is conditional on the provision, by the staff member at the time of application, of evidence of insurability satisfactory to Aetna.  Aetna reserves the right to reject any reapplication and may require the applicant to undergo a medical examination at the applicant’s own expense.  If reapplication is accepted, coverage begins from the date Aetna gives its written consent.   Special Leave without Pay  Periods of special leave without pay (SLWOP) for less than one calendar month do not affect the coverage to which the staff member has subscribed.  For periods of leave that exceed one month, staff members have the option of continuing coverage by making full payment of the premiums involved, in advance, on a quarterly basis, as follows:  For international and local staff members stationed in New York, contact the UN Health and Life Insurance Section to arrange for payment of premiums  For international staff members stationed outside New York, forward a cheque made payable to the UN for the full amount of the premiums to UN Health and Life Insurance Section    For local staff members stationed outside New York, arrange payments through the Human Resources/Operations Manager at the duty station concerned  Staff members who choose not to retain coverage during a period of special leave without pay (SLWOP) of more than two months’ duration, may re-enroll in the plan only on the basis of satisfactory evidence of insurability. Retroactive payment of premiums for a period of SLWOP in order to become entitled to after-service coverage will not be accepted.  Transfer between payrolling duty stations and employing organizations, and breaks in service It should be noted that there is no automatic continuation of coverage when a staff member:  Transfers from one payrolling duty station to another.   Moves from one employing organization to another; or    Is reappointed after a break in service  Therefore, to ensure continuity of coverage in the plan, staff members must make arrangements to re-enrol upon:  Transfer to a new payrolling duty station  Change of employing organization; or   Reappointment after a break in service  To be assured of unbroken life insurance coverage, re-enrollment in the life insurance plan must be accomplished no later than two months following the date of transfer or reappointment; otherwise, an evidence of insurability statement will be required. Designation of beneficiary  Since life insurance benefits are payable to the participant’s beneficiary, it is most important for each participant in the plan to designate the person or persons to whom the participant wishes the benefit to be paid.  For the payment of benefits, the insurance company recognizes only the most recent, properly executed form for the designation of beneficiaries.  It is the responsibility of the staff member or former staff member to make sure that the proper person or persons are designated, particularly after death, divorce, or other changes in the relationship between the person or persons previously designated and the staff member or former staff member.  Changes in the designation of beneficiaries may be made at any time.   The appropriate Designation of Beneficiary form (Revocable or Irrevocable) must be forwarded to:  if an international or local staff member stationed in New York, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the organizational unit, for onforwarding to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section;  if an international staff member stationed outside New York, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the duty station, for onforwarding to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section; and  if a local staff member stationed outside New York, the Human Resources/Operations Manager at the duty station concerned.  The form is kept locally and does not need to be forwarded to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section.  Legal agreements  After enrollment, the participant may enter into any of the following legal agreements:  Creditor Designation of Beneficiary, which may be used, for example, to secure a loan  Irrevocable Designation of Beneficiary, which may be used, for example, in divorce or related proceedings  Assignment of Group Coverage, which may be used, for example, for tax purposes, in consultation with a legal adviser (not the Organization or Aetna)  If the participant wishes to enter into any of the above legal agreements, the applicable form must be sent to:  If an international or local staff member stationed in New York, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the organizational unit, who will forward it to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section for processing before Aetna  If an international staff member stationed outside New York, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the duty station, who will forward it to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section for processing before Aetna  If a local staff member stationed outside New York, the Human Resources/Operations Manager at the duty station concerned, who will forward it to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section for processing before Aetna Claims Filing a claim  All claims must be processed through the:  Chief, Health and Life Insurance Section United Nations New York, NY 10017 Fax: (212) 906 4222  Claims or notification of claims should not be transmitted directly to Aetna.  In the event of death of a staff member, a notification must be sent to the Chief, UN Health and Life Insurance Section by:   For international or local staff members stationed in New York, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the organizational unit  For international staff members stationed outside New York, the Human Resources Specialist in OHR Copenhagen serving the duty station  For local staff members stationed outside New York, the Human Resources/Operations Manager at the duty station concerned  When notifying the Chief of the UN Health and Life Insurance Section, the following documentation must be provided:  All insurance application forms, including initial and re-enrolment, where applicable  Evidence of insurability records, where applicable  Appropriate forms changing the beneficiary designation  Payroll records documenting the deduction of group life insurance premiums or the direct payment by staff member during periods of SLWOP  Certification by the OHR Human Resources Specialist or local Human Resources/ Operations Manager of:  The last day the staff member reported to work  Close of business (COB) separation date  Date of the last premium deduction and, in the base currency, amount of premium and level of pensionable remuneration for the last full month of service  The Chief, UN Health and Life Insurance Section, will send a letter to the beneficiary with instructions and detailing the additional required documentation, which includes:  The original or a legally certified copy of the insured’s death certificate (a death certificate furnished to the UN Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF) will not suffice for life insurance purposes). Information on the UNJSPF can be downloaded from their website: http://www.unjspf.org.  Official medical certification as to the cause of death, when not stated on the death certificate  Completed UN group life insurance programme beneficiary certification forms. There are two forms:  For those beneficiaries who do not have US Social Security and do not reside in USA  For those who reside in the USA  Additional documentation (such as court-ordered documents or English translations) may be required in circumstances where:  A beneficiary is deceased, a copy of the beneficiary’s death certificate.  If all beneficiaries are deceased, evidence of the legally recognized appointment of the person designated to administer the assets/property (referred to as “estate” under US law) of the insured.  Or, should any beneficiary die after the insured but before a claim is paid, court papers appointing a person to administer the “estate” of that beneficiary.  Should there be no corresponding legal concept under applicable national laws, proceeds will be paid to the estate of the insured (or of the beneficiary) and those closest to the deceased may seek documents under their national law governing the line of legal succession, permitting a bank to accept a deposit of a benefit cheque.  Beneficiaries have not reached the age of majority, the legally recognized appointment of the guardian of the “estate” (assets/property) of the minor child.  Where such guardian is a surviving parent living outside the US, a copy of the national law governing minor children, stating that the surviving parent automatically becomes the guardian of the property of a minor child and setting out the age of majority, along with a copy of the child’s birth certificate establishing the names of the father and the mother, may be submitted in lieu of court papers.  Oaths sworn before a notary do not satisfy the requirements of Aetna’s legal department.  Death may be considered accidental, the official police report, setting out the circumstances that resulted in the death of the insured (inter alia, the time of day, weather conditions, testimony of eyewitnesses, diagrams) and any autopsy statement/medical report.   Death occurs within two years of the approval date indicated on an evidence of insurability statement, all medical records for the previous five years. Payment  GLIP is a global plan, administered on a highly decentralized basis, and gathering all documentation and records required to process a claim could take some time.  Following submission of all required documentation to Aetna, the beneficiary will normally receive life insurance proceeds within three to four weeks directly from Aetna.    Method  Each beneficiary will receive an individual cheque (principal amount plus interest earned) by a secure mode of delivery.  Aetna benefit cheques have no expiry date.  It should be noted that Aetna does not deposit benefit proceeds directly into bank accounts.  Currency of payment  Payment will be made in US dollars.  Staff paid in currencies other than US dollars  Benefits payable by Aetna will be the equivalent in US dollars of the entitlement of the participant in local currency converted at the UN official rate of exchange, in effect on the date of the event giving rise to the claim.  US taxes  The life insurance principal payable to individuals is exempt from all US taxes. The tax exemption does not apply if life insurance proceeds are paid to an estate that is subject to US taxes.    Interests  Life insurance benefits, upon the death of the insured, earn interest at a rate determined by Aetna until the date on which proceeds are paid to beneficiaries.  Unlike the life insurance principal, interest earned may be subject to taxation.  Group life insurance participants may wish to note that there is no prescribed timeframe for submitting claims. After-Service Life Insurance (ASLI) After-service benefits  To become eligible for post-retirement life insurance benefits, staff members must have been active participants in the life insurance programme prior to their separation from service.  No application is necessary to qualify for after-service coverage for active participants.     Free coverage  Staff members who are participants in the group life insurance plan and have at least 10 years contributory participation upon their separation from UNDP, shall receive continuing basic life insurance coverage, without payment of premium, as follows:  Prior to age 55:          One year’s free coverage at the level in effect at the time of separation for each completed 10-year period of contributory participation   At the end of this period of free coverage, the life insurance coverage ceases unless the participant either again becomes a staff member and renews his/her participation in the plan, if eligible, or makes arrangements with Aetna to continue coverage under the conversion option (see Conversion Privileges section)  From age 55:  Between ages 55 and 69, coverage on separation from service is 50 percent of the level of coverage in effect at the time of separation   Between ages 70 and 74, coverage is 25 percent of the level of coverage in effect at the time of separation   From age 75, coverage is 10 percent of the level of coverage in effect at the time of separation.  The minimum after 75 is the lesser of US$5,000 or the amount to which the after-service participant would be entitled before age 75.  The maximum after age 75 is US$10,000.    The reduction to US$150,000 at age 62, while still in service, will be ignored in these calculations.  In the case of those participants who signed a waiver of automatic increase in coverage prior to 1 January 2001, the date on which the waiver option expires, free life insurance coverage will be based on the level of coverage in effect on the date of separation from service, rather than the full amount that he/she was eligible for.  Staff terminated for reasons of health in accordance with UN Staff Regulation 9.1 (a) are eligible to receive free life insurance coverage equal to their coverage on the date of separation, up to age 62.  After 62, the percentage factors set out in paragraph 70 apply. Documentation required for After-Service Insurance  OHR Human Resources Specialists and local Human Resources/Operations Managers are required to submit the following group life insurance documentation to the UN Health and Life Insurance Section whenever an insured staff member separates from service in order to establish the entitlement to ASLI benefits:  All insurance application forms, including initial and re-enrollment, where applicable    Evidence of insurability records, where applicable  Appropriate forms changing the beneficiary designation  Termination of life insurance records, where applicable  Payroll records documenting the deduction of group life insurance premiums or the direct payment by staff member during periods of SLWOP  Certification by the OHR Human Resources Specialist or Human Resources/Operations Manager of:  The last day the staff member reported to work  Close of business (cob) separation date  Date of the last premium deduction and, in the base currency, amount of premium and level of pensionable remuneration for the last full month of service Discontinuance of accidental death & dismemberment coverage   There is no after-service coverage for accidental death or dismemberment; therefore, this portion of the insurance plan terminates at the end of the month in which the staff member separates from service. Re-employment of retired staff  Under the after-service health insurance programme (ASHI), if, as a result of a new post-retirement appointment, a former staff member again becomes a participant in the Pension Fund, the monthly pension benefit is suspended and, for the duration of this suspension, eligibility for the ASHI programme is also suspended.  In the case of the After-Life Insurance Programme (ASLI), though, there is no link with Pension Fund status and, therefore, a post-retirement appointment of any duration with the Organization does not lead to a suspension of benefits under ASLI.  Suspension of ASLI will occur only if a former staff member is eligible and elects to re-enrol in the life insurance programme for the period of re-employment.  Assessment should be made as to whether the level of coverage as a premium-paying staff member or the ASLI benefit is more advantageous.  Except for periods of optional re-enrolment, the ASLI entitlement remains in effect. Conversion privileges Conversion to individual coverage  All staff members who, at the time of their separation from service, are participating in the plan may make arrangements directly with Aetna to convert to an individual policy under conditions established by Aetna, without having to produce further evidence of insurability.  The premium rate schedule pertaining to the conversion life insurance policy is age-based and bears no relationship to the premium structure of the UN group life insurance plan.  The participant is then solely responsible for paying and remitting the premiums to Aetna.  Inquiries as to contract terms and premium payment instructions, as well as completed applications, should be directed to:  Aetna Conversion Unit 151 Farmington Avenue Hartford, CT 06156-1992 Tel: 800-523-5065 (in USA)   Tel: 860-273-7150 (outside USA)  The amount of life insurance that may be converted is based on the level of coverage at the time of separation, as follows:  Staff members under age 55 or those with fewer than 10 years of contribution participation in the plan may convert up to the full amount of their life insurance at separation  Staff members who separate before age 55 and who qualify for a year of free coverage for each 10 years of contribution participation may convert up to that amount at the end of the period of free coverage  Staff members over 55 who qualify for ASLI may convert with Aetna to an individual policy, the amount of the decrease in coverage at separation or, as ASLI participants, at ages 70 and 75.  For example, if a staff member has US$100,000 of coverage at separation, the ASLI benefit would be US$50,000.  In this case, the staff member may convert up to the US$50,000 difference in coverage.  When the former staff member reaches age 70 and the after-service benefit drops to US$25,000, he/she may convert the US$25,000 difference between the new level and the prior US$50,000 ASLI level.  The conversion privilege must be exercised within 31 days:  Following termination of coverage under the UN plan; or   The date on which the ASLI coverage is reduced as the participant grows older.

    "mobility-and-hardship": "Mobility and Hardship  This policy takes effect on 1 July 2016, and introduces changes to the former allowances of Mobility Allowance and Additional Hardship Allowance, and amends elements of the former version of the Hardship Allowance. It also records the discontinuation of the Non-Removal Allowance on the same date, and addresses transitional arrangements from the old scheme to the new one.  Elements of the Scheme The mobility and hardship scheme consists of the following non-pensionable allowances:  A mobility incentive, which varies according to the number of assignments to field duty stations and the purpose of which is to provide an incentive for the geographic mobility of staff in support of field operations;  A hardship allowance, the purpose of which is to compensate for the varying degrees of hardship at different field duty stations;   A non-family service allowance, the purpose of which is to recognize service in non-family duty stations.  Eligibility   Staff in the Professional and higher categories (i.e., International Professional staff), and staff in the Field Service category are eligible for payment of the allowances under this scheme, provided they meet the requirements set out below and subject to the particular conditions governing each allowance, as described in the following paragraphs.   Eligibility for the mobility incentive normally requires a geographic move to a new field duty station, for a period of one year or longer (unless otherwise provided).  The allowances under this scheme are not considered expatriate benefits, and may be paid to eligible staff members serving in their home country.  When staff members eligible for payment of the allowances are on travel status, and receive a daily subsistence allowance as a result, the incentives/allowances under the Mobility and Hardship scheme shall continue to be paid on the basis of their appointment at the parent duty station. Payment of the incentives/allowances is subject to official change of duty station.     Category and designation of duty stations   All duty stations are designated by the International Civil Service Commission in one of six categories: H, and A to E. Duty stations in category H are headquarters and similarly designated locations where the United Nations has no development or humanitarian assistance programme, or locations in countries that are members of the European Union. The A to E categories comprise all other duty stations, classified by order of difficulty of conditions of life and work. Staff members are informed of the category of their duty station on an annual basis or more frequently if there is a change in classification.   For the purpose of payment of the non-family service allowance, a duty station is designated as “non-family” by the Chairman of the International Civil Service Commission when the medium- or longer-term presence of non-essential staff and/or recognized spouses and/or dependent children in the staff member’s duty station is deemed dangerous or unsuitable for reasons of their safety and security. A decision regarding whether to designate a duty station as “non-family” is normally taken within six months of the declaration of evacuation or relocation of non-essential staff and/or family members.  Amounts  The amount of the allowances payable to each eligible staff member may vary by grade level and dependency status. Annex 1 shows the applicable amounts by individual circumstances.  Mobility Incentive Qualifying service   To qualify for payment of the mobility allowance, a staff member must have five years’ prior continuous service on a fixed-term or continuing appointment as a staff member of the United Nations common system. When qualifying service has been broken by separation from service as defined in UN Staff Rule 9.1, such service accrued before the separation shall be forfeited and a new period shall begin upon the staff member’s re-employment. Service credited towards the five-year service requirement may include service as a staff member in one of the categories eligible for payment of the allowance as well as prior service in a non-eligible category when allowed under (see section on counting assignments).   At all duty stations classified in categories A to E, the mobility incentive is payable from the second assignment, provided the requirement of five years’ consecutive service has been met.   Service shall not be considered as broken by periods of special leave of less than 30 days, but full months of special leave without pay shall not be credited towards the five-year service requirement.  Staff members holding temporary appointments are not eligible to receive the mobility incentive regardless of any exceptional extension of their appointment beyond 364 days.  Determining the assignment number   For the purpose of this policy, the term “assignment”, when determining the assignment number of the staff member, shall be understood to mean either the initial appointment of a staff member to a duty station, or reassignment for a period of one year or longer of a staff member to a new duty station beyond commuting distance, including duty stations classified as headquarters duty stations.   Initial appointments of one year or longer, and assignments of one year or longer which involve a change of duty station, shall each be counted as one assignment, provided the staff member completes a minimum one year period of service in each of the relevant duty stations.  If a staff member is assigned to a duty station for a period of one year or longer and such time is subsequently reduced at the initiative of the Organization to less than one year, such service may be counted as an assignment on an exceptional basis.  In other cases, counting of assignments shall be made as follows:   Exceptional periods of service on daily subsistence allowance for a period of one year or longer at the same duty station are counted as one assignment, but only upon reassignment to a new parent duty station;  All service in the General Service and National Professional Officer category counts for one assignment, irrespective of the number of assignments in those categories.   Transfers, secondments and loans to other organizations of the United Nations common system shall be counted in the same manner as movements within the Organization;  Periods of service under a fixed-term appointment of one year or longer as a Junior Professional Officer, shall be counted in the same way as other internationally recruited staff.  Periods of service as a United Nations Volunteer are not counted.  Periods of service on a temporary appointment are not counted.  Duration   After five consecutive years at one duty station, payment of the mobility incentive will cease. The count towards the five years begins as of the date of appointment or assignment at the duty station. Periods of service away from the parent duty station on assignment or travel status shall not suspend the counting of five years. Full months of special leave without pay shall suspend the counting of five years, and the count shall resume upon return to service.  In the exceptional case of staff members who remain at the same duty station at the explicit request of the Organization or for compelling humanitarian reasons, the payment of the mobility incentive may continue for a maximum period of one additional year, for a total of six consecutive years at one duty station.   Hardship allowance   The hardship allowance is payable for assignments to duty stations classified in categories B, C, D and E, for the duration of each assignment according to the applicable level of hardship classification of the duty station.    Non-family Service Allowance  The non-family service allowance is payable to eligible staff members who are assigned to duty stations officially designated as non-family. No payment of the allowance shall be made when the presence of a family member is exceptionally approved by the designated official irrespective of whether other eligible family members continue to remain outside of the non-family duty station.  If there is a change in the designation of the duty station from family to non-family status during the course of a staff member’s appointment or assignment to the duty station, the non-family service allowance shall be payable as of the effective date of the change in the duty station designation.  If there is a change in the designation of the duty station from non-family to family during the course of a staff member’s appointment assignment to the duty station, the allowance shall be discontinued following a transition period: For staff members with no dependents, the allowance is discontinued three months after the effective date of change in the duty station designation;  For staff members with dependents, the allowance may be paid up to six months following the effective date of change in the duty station designation or until an eligible family member joins the staff member at the duty station, whichever is earlier.   Relationship to other allowances and entitlements   Amounts paid on account of the mobility and hardship scheme shall not be taken into account in the calculation of the rental subsidy to which staff members may be entitled.   A staff member is not eligible for the non-family service allowance while concurrently receiving the security evacuation allowance (SEA) for eligible family members. Accordingly, payment of the security evacuation allowance shall cease upon payment of the non-family service allowance.  A staff member in receipt of the non-family service allowance who is temporarily relocated or evacuated from a non-family duty station will continue to be eligible for payment of the security evacuation allowance for himself or herself as long as he/she remain assigned to the non-family duty station.  Transitional measures  As a transitional measure, staff members in receipt of the former non-removal allowance on 30 June 2016 shall continue to receive payment of the allowance for up to five years at the same duty station or until the staff member moves to another duty station, whichever is earlier.    Eligible staff members who moved to their new assignment before 1 July 2016 shall continue to receive current mobility allowance amounts up to 5 years at the same duty station, or until they are re-assigned to another duty station, whichever is earlier.

    "mobility": "Mobility  Objective    Staff mobility is a critical part of an integrated talent management system. Given that UNDP’s workforce is its greatest asset, it is vital for the organization to ensure that we have the right person in the right place at the right time. By doing so, each staff member will be able to contribute their full capacity and potential to the achievement of UNDP’s crucial mission. The implementation of the Mobility Policy will enable staff to develop and enhance knowledge and expertise and build new professional experiences in different operating environments and contexts.  It will also enhance the general quality of the talent available in UNDP, as well as facilitate individual development and career progression. The latter is critical, as the ability to have diverse and fulfilling career journeys is one of the key expectations of UNDP personnel and an important prerequisite for attracting, developing and retaining high quality talent. For this reason, staff mobility is a key component of People for 2030 and is essential if UNDP is to capitalize on the human resources on which we rely. It is part of a fundamental overhaul of the talent management system and is designed to leverage maximum results full integration with new approaches on career management, leadership development, performance management, and learning and development.  The Policy sets out provisions governing staff mobility and, as such, aims to:   Enable more effective and efficient staff mobility within UNDP.   Ensure that staff moves are managed strategically and that each established position is continuously filled. Create opportunities for career development and continuous learning, as part of an integrated employee experience, through multi-directional moves driven both by business needs and staff aspirations. Strengthen UNDP’s ability to attract and retain a diverse and dynamic world-class global workforce that will effectively meet the Organization’s current and future operational needs.   Applicability   The Policy applies to all International Professional (IP) staff members holding a UNDP Letter of Appointment and hired on Fixed-Term Appointments (FTA) and Permanent Appointments (PA).   The Policy does not apply to staff members holding UNDP Letters of Appointment for service limited to another UN entity. It also does not apply to staff in locally recruited positions (National Officers and General Service categories), staff hired on Temporary Appointments (TA) and other personnel on any other contractual modality.  The Policy supersedes UNDP/ADM/00/29 of 16 November 2000 on UNDP Reassignment Policy and the Personnel Manual section on Reassignment (Section 20303) revised on 2 November 2000.   Key Definitions  Mobility is defined as periodic moves of staff to new or re-classified positions within the same or different occupational group/functional area, laterally or to a different level, within the same or different duty station.   Types of mobility include: Geographic mobility is movement of staff between different duty stations, in most situations requiring movement to a different country.   Functional mobility is movement of staff between positions in the same or different occupational group/functional area, whether geographically or not. Inter-agency mobility is movement of staff to another Fund, Programme or Agency in the United Nations Common System, through a secondment, loan or transfer.  Mobility requirement is a requirement to periodically move to a new position.  Duration of assignment (tour of duty) is the period of time, during which a staff member is expected to be in the position s/he has been selected for and accepted. Minimum duration of assignment (tour of duty) is the minimum period of time a staff member must stay in a position. Maximum duration of assignment (tour of duty) is the maximum period of time a staff member is allowed to stay in a position.   All IP positions are designated as rotational or non-rotational.   Rotational positions are positions subject to rotation. They include positions that exist in multiple country offices, HQs Bureaux/offices and in global and regional offices/centres. Their profiles, in terms of functions, qualifications, experience, competencies, expected contribution, level of responsibility and outputs are generally similar to those of multiple positions across UNDP. All rotational positions are subject to an Annual Rotation Exercise (ARE), though rotational positions may also be filled outside of the ARE when vacant or when it is in the interest of UNDP to do so.  Non-rotational positions are positions not subject to rotation and include the majority of other IP positions which still have a mobility requirement. There is also a small number of highly specialized positions whose incumbents do not have a mobility requirement (e.g. Comptroller, Treasurer, certain positions in the Executive Office etc.).    Rotation is a centrally managed process of assigning staff to rotational positions. Staff can participate in a rotation exercise whether or not they encumber a rotational position.  A Candidate Pool is a group of staff who are confirmed to meet qualifications and competency requirements established for certain positions.   Key Provisions  General Provisions  UNDP expects all International Professional staff to be mobile. Entry into the International Professional service entails a commitment to serve in any professional-level UNDP position in any duty station, anywhere in the world, where it is considered, by the Administrator, that the staff member can make their greatest contribution to the objectives of the Organization.  Most of the International Professional staff will have to meet a mobility requirement, i.e. be required to periodically move to new or reclassified positions. UNDP local staff (National Officers and General Service categories) do not have a mobility requirement, however, they are still strongly encouraged to periodically move, as much as feasible, within their duty stations. They can also apply to move to a different staff category, e.g. from local to International Professional positions.   To enable mobility, all UNDP IP positions must be advertised internally first. Any exceptions (including concurrent advertisement internally and externally) will require first an approval by the respective Bureau Director and then by the Director, Office of Human Resources.  Mobility Mechanisms  Several mechanisms are available to enable effective staff mobility. These include:  Rotation, a centrally managed process to be used for reassignments to rotational positions; A regular recruitment/selection process to be used for reassignments to non-rotational positions; Other selection processes (lateral moves, placement of unassigned staff, strategic placement, etc.).   Regular recruitment processes as well as lateral moves, placement of unassigned staff and strategic placement are governed by the Recruitment and Selection Policy and other relevant administrative issuances.    Designation of Positions as Rotational and Non-rotational   The Director, Office of Human Resources, in consultation with the respective Bureau Directors, is responsible for designating international professional positions as either rotational or non-rotational. Procedures and criteria for the designation of positions as rotational or non-rotational will be issued separately.  All job descriptions and vacancy announcements for international professional positions will indicate whether the position is rotational or non-rotational.    Duration of Assignment (Tour of Duty) for Rotational Positions  The duration of assignment (tour of duty) in a rotational position is determined based on the mobility and hardship classification of the duty station, which is established by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) according to the prevailing living conditions.   The following standard tours of duty are established for UNDP:   For NY Headquarters and other H locations, the duration is six (6) years. Staff can serve in multiple assignments at the same H locations. For A, B and C duty stations the duration is four (4) years. Staff can serve in multiple assignments at the same A, B and C locations, where suitable positions exist. For D and E duty stations, the maximum duration is two (2) years, which also applies to project staff in these duty stations. The number of consecutive assignments in D and E duty stations is limited to two (2).   Rotational moves can occur within the same duty stations if staff move between different positions or if the position they encumbered was reclassified and if they are successfully confirmed in the reclassified position.   It is expected that IP staff members will complete the full standard tour of duty determined for their position. To respond to UNDP operational needs or for compelling personal reasons the tour of duty may be extended or shortened. Extension or foreshortening of a tour of duty in a rotational position may occur upon approval by the Director, Office of Human Resources at the request of the respective Bureau Director in the case of operational need. Staff members may request an extension or foreshortening of the tour of duty in the case of compelling personal reasons by first obtaining approval by the respective Bureau Director, and then obtaining approval by the Director, OHR.   Staff members in positions subject to rotation are expected to start applying to other positions during the last year of their tour of duty.  IP staff members may be considered for positions after they have served in their current position for one (1) year for D and E duty stations and two (2) years for all other duty stations (considered the “minimum duration of assignment”).  Restrictions related to the tour of duty for rotational positions will not apply to staff who encumber positions which are abolished or reclassified, and staff close to retirement (staff within two years of reaching the normal retirement age as defined under the applicable Staff Rules).   By the time of completion of the tour of duty, staff members need to secure a new position, otherwise they will become unassigned and could be separated. Offers of positions to unassigned staff members, who would otherwise be separated from the Organization, must comply with Staff Rule 9.6 as well as UNDP’s relevant administrative issuances, including the Recruitment and Selection policy and the Standard Operating Procedures for Unassigned Permanent Appointment holders.   Any exceptions from the mobility requirement or other provisions of the Policy will require approval by the Director, Office of Human Resources. Such cases will be considered on a case by case basis.    Duration of Assignment (Tour of Duty) for Non-Rotational Positions  The moves of staff in non-rotational positions will primarily be managed through a regular recruitment/selection process.  Unless an exception is obtained, the maximum duration of assignment for non-rotational positions is seven (7) years. In D and E duty stations the expected duration of assignment in a non-rotational position is two (2) years and the number of consecutive assignments in D and E duty stations is limited to two (2).   By the time a staff member completes the maximum duration of assignment (or sooner, based on business needs), they need to secure another position to move to. Otherwise, they may be without an assignment. UNDP may decide to offer to the staff member a reassignment to another position or relocate the position to another duty station in accordance with the mobility requirement. Failure to accept an assignment may result in separation.    For staff serving in development projects, the duration of assignment will be linked to the duration of a project, except for staff in D and E duty stations (see paragraph 29).   IP staff members may be considered for other positions after they have served in their current position for one (1) year for D and E duty stations and two (2) years for all other duty stations (considered the “minimum duration of assignment”).   Restrictions related to the duration of assignment for non-rotational positions will not apply to staff who encumber positions which are abolished or reclassified  and staff close to retirement (staff within two years of reaching the normal retirement age as defined under the applicable Staff Rules) as well as to the incumbents of the positions that do not have a mobility requirement (e.g. Comptroller, Treasurer, etc.).   Any exceptions from the duration of assignments beyond seven (7) years requires approval by the Director, Office of Human Resources at the request of the respective Bureau Director. Such cases will be considered on a case by case basis.    Equitable Balance of Assignments  In the course of a UNDP career, staff are encouraged to have different types of assignments and serve in duty stations with different degrees of hardship. Staff members with service in D and E duty stations who have reached the maximum tour of duty in D and E duty stations in the current tour will be given preference over equivalent staff members in other duty stations in accordance with the provisions of the Staff Regulations and Rules and applicable UNDP policies.  Rotation  Rotation: General Provisions  \t Staff members in rotational positions are expected to move once they complete the maximum tour of duty to another position in the same or different duty station.   Reassignment of staff subject to rotation will be done through an Annual Rotation Exercise (ARE).  There will be two types of AREs – for positions sourced from the Candidate Pools and for all other rotational positions.  Entry into a Candidate Pool is subject to passing an assessment. Staff member performance as reflected in their performance assessment may be considered in the context of allowing a staff member to enter or remain in the candidate pool. Staff will not be considered for positions in the ARE if they do not have satisfactory performance.   Candidate Pool membership will be reviewed every two years taking into account the following criteria: interests of UNDP, qualifications and competencies of staff members and how they align with UNDP’s talent needs,  performance, instances of refusal of assignments, and number of successful and unsuccessful “expressions of interest” as part of AREs.    A staff member will be automatically removed from a Candidate Pool in the following circumstances:  Staff member separates from UNDP; Staff member requests to be removed from the Candidate Pool; Staff member refuses twice an assignment offer without a compelling reason, as determined by the Director, Office of Human Resources; Staff member obtains an unsatisfactory performance rating in the applicable performance review;  Staff member is imposed a disciplinary measure.  Rotation: Annual Rotation Exercise for Positions Sourced from the Candidate Pools  The Administrator has assigned the responsibility to facilitate and service the reassignment process to the Director, Office of Human Resources.   The Annual Rotation Exercise (ARE) is administered by OHR/BMS in accordance with the process outlined in Annex 2, part 1.    The objective of the ARE is to identify the most suitable candidates from the Candidate Pools for the positions advertised in the Annual Rotation Catalog (ARC) against the requirements of the positions, to ensure a corporate approach to decisions related to reassignments, and, to the extent possible, to provide the selected staff members with sufficient time to plan and implement their moves.    Rotation: Annual Rotation Exercise for Other Rotational Positions  The Administrator has assigned, the responsibility to facilitate and service the reassignment process to the Director, Office of Human Resources.   The Annual Rotation Exercise (ARE) is administered by OHR/BMS in accordance with the process outlined in Annex 2, part 2.   The objective of the ARE is to identify the most suitable UNDP internal candidates for positions advertised in the Annual Rotation Catalog (ARC) against the requirements of the positions, to ensure a corporate approach to decisions related to reassignments, and, to the extent possible, to provide the selected staff members with sufficient time to plan and implement their moves.     Timing of Reassignments  For rotational positions, reassignments to new positions will generally take place during the period of June through August in order to minimize disruption to the work of the offices involved and to the life of the staff member (e.g. leave and school calendars). Reassignment decisions are expected to be taken from February through May.   Obligation to accept assignments    At the time that any assignment decisions are taken, UNDP will take into account, to the extent possible, all relevant factors. Staff members should inform UNDP about special needs or conditions that may be considered.   Bureau Directors may request a waiver from the Director, Office of Human Resources, to delay the reassignment of the staff in critical functions, where a time-limited extension is in the best interest of UNDP.   Staff members may request a personal waiver to delay the reassignment or not to accept a particular assignment for medical or other compelling reasons. Personal waivers will be approved by the Director, Office of Human Resources, in consultation with the respective Bureau Directors.   The staff member who requests a personal waiver to delay the reassignment or declines an offer of a particular assignment, including a temporary assignment, may do so by providing the Director, Office of Human Resources, with a written justification for the request.  The Director, Office of Human Resources, will review this request and, if it is found to be valid, will defer the reassignment or initiate that the reassignment be reconsidered on an exceptional basis.    Failure to rotate, or to accept a reassignment and to report for duty following the reassignment decision, may constitute non-compliance with the staff member’s contractual obligations. Failure to rotate, or to accept an assignment and to report for duty following a reassignment, may constitute a basis for separation from service.    After two refusals of a reassignment offer without a compelling reason, staff members who are in the Candidate Pools will be removed from the respective Pools.      Inter-Agency Mobility   The Administrator will continue to support the exchange of staff within the United Nations system through a transfer, secondment or loan. The vacancy announcements of the various agencies give details of opportunities for inter-organization movements of this kind.   When an inter-organization move has been initiated by a staff member, UNDP will make reasonable effort to facilitate it. When such a move is in the interest of the Organization, UNDP will facilitate it.     Temporary Assignment   In order to support mobility and help staff acquire requisite experiences across regions, functions and UNDP business units, to provide career development and exploratory opportunities to staff, as well as to support offices with interim and surge capacity, temporary assignments of up to 12 months can be used. Placement on a temporary assignment do not constitute the fulfilment of a mobility requirement. Annex 1.

    "national-personnel-services-agreement": "National Personnel Services Agreement (NPSA)                     Introduction and Background     Overview:  The National Personnel Service Agreement (“NPSA”) is a legal instrument, in the form of a contract modality, established by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The agreement is to engage the services of individuals to provide a time-limited service to UNDP under a service-based contract modality.   This modality has two key objectives: On the one hand, the NPSA aims to provide UNDP with a comprehensive, flexible and cost-effective contractual framework which responds to project, programme, operational and administrative, requirements. On the other, the NPSA will provide for attractive, stable and fair conditions of employment which ensure that UNDP is able to attract, select and retain the services of skilled, high-performing individuals.   Individuals engaged under the NPSA Framework have the status of National Personnel Service Agreement holders and are engaged in recognition of their skills and expertise in order to deliver on identified functional requirements. These individuals are not UNDP staff members, but are instead considered part of UNDP’s personnel and, as such, are not governed by or subject to the United Nations’ Staff Regulations and Rules. Nor is this contract modality governed by national legislation in countries where UNDP operates. Given that the services covered by the NPSA may only be provided by natural and not legal persons (e.g., duly formed/registered companies), as well as by non-incorporated partnerships, the NPSA falls within the overall scope of UNDP’s Human Resource management framework.  The NPSA may also be used by UNDP to contract individuals on behalf of UN entities (“partners”) to which it may provide such services. This facility is provided for in the related policy on Partner Personnel Service Agreement (“PPSA”). Such contracts will be administered by UNDP, while the contracted personnel will be supervised by the partner organization.   The NPSA is governed solely by its expressed terms and conditions, including the Terms of Reference (“TOR”).   Applicability:   The following policy shall apply to National Personnel Service Agreements concluded by UNDP to perform services for UNDP. UNV and UNCDF can hire NPAs in accordance with this Policy under the same conditions applicable to UNDP.  A holder of a National PSA is a person engaged by UNDP to perform a specific assignment locally, provided the NPSA holder is legally allowed to work in the country, and may only be engaged to perform either support or specialist services in duty stations where UNDP maintains the National Professional Officer category. In HQ duty stations, NPSAs may also be issued to nationals of countries other than that of the country in which the services will be provided, so long as (i) the host government does not disallow it, and (ii) an NPSA remuneration scale for the respective HQ duty station has been established.    Use of NPSA     The NPSA is to be used when engaging individuals in any of the following circumstances:     When undertaking the performance of specific task(s) or delivery of work for the implementation of project(s) or other activities of a business unit which is funded by a project (or projects) or a non-continuous source of funding, and required for a defined period of time (for example, for the duration of the active project(s) carried out by UNDP or its funding;      When undertaking the performance of specific task(s) that is/are needed because of the variable business volume due to the nature of UNDP’s business model;     When the services may not be needed long-term by UNDP;     The NPSA may not be used in the following cases:   When the functions are of both, inherent and continuous in nature (as defined in Annex 4).   To re-instate a staff member whose previous post/function of identical nature has been abolished.      As a means of applying a probationary period to candidates prior to offering them a staff appointment.    Where the services required based on specific deliverables and payments are lumpsum-based. In such cases, the Individual Contract (IC) modality of UNDP should be used, governed by its own set of procurement guidelines. Automatic conversions from IC to NPSA are not possible given that the two modalities follow two very different purposes and assessments, except during the transition period indicated above.   Offices of wider coverage In office where the functional coverage is expected to be beyond the country in which the primary UNDP office is based, the NPSA modality may still be applicable even if the functions are of global, regional or multi-country nature. Examples of such offices may be HQs, Regional Offices and Regional Service Centers, as well as Multi Country Offices. Such functions do not necessarily warrant an IPSA.  Legal Status of the NPSA holder  A person providing services under an NPSA shall be known as an NPSA holder and is engaged pursuant to the expressed terms and conditions of the NPSA. NPSA holders are not recruited under United Nations Staff Regulations and Rules and UNDP business units must ensure that the administration of NPSAs is consistent with the NPSA Policy, their contract and their status.     NPSA holders have the legal status of a contractor vis-à-vis UNDP and are neither staff members of UNDP nor of any other entity of the United Nations (“UN”) under the Staff Regulations and Rules of the UN. Nor are they “officials” of UNDP or any other entity of the UN for the purposes of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, adopted by the General Assembly of the UN on 13 February 1946 (“General Convention”).         NPSA holders may have the status of “expert on mission for the United Nations” under Section 22, Article VI, of the General Convention, and perform official duties for the United Nations. Whether or not an NPSA holder can be recognized as an expert within the framework of the General Convention is an issue that, if the need arises, will be conclusively determined by the Secretary-General of the United Nations or his/her delegate, the UN Legal Counsel, through the Legal Office of UNDP.   NPSA holders have neither the authority nor any other right to incur any legal or financial obligations on behalf of UNDP. The NPSA holder may not expressly or implicitly represent to any person an authority that the NPSA holder does not have.  General Rights and Obligations of the NPSA holders     Rights and obligations under the NPSA are strictly limited to its express terms and conditions.     General rights and obligations:    The terms and conditions of the NPSA differ from those applicable to UNDP staff members appointed under the UN Staff Regulations and Rules. NPSA holders are excluded inter alia from participation in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund and After-Service Health Insurance. Further, NPSA holders shall not be entitled to any additional benefit, payment, subsidy, compensation or entitlement, except those expressly stated in the NPSA.    NPSA holders may neither seek nor accept any instructions in connection with UNDP from any authority external to UNDP. Should any authority external to UNDP seek to impose any instructions on NPSA holders in connection with UNDP, they must promptly notify UNDP and provide all reasonable assistance required by UNDP to address this matter. An NPSA holder must not take any action that may adversely affect the interests of UNDP and must perform their obligations under the NPSA with the fullest regard to the interests of UNDP. During the period of service with UNDP, an NPSA holder must refrain from any conduct that would reflect adversely on UNDP or the rest of the UN system (or both), and must  not engage in  any activity  that is  incompatible with their performance of services for UNDP under the NPSA.   During the term of the NPSA, and even after the expiration or termination of an NPSA, NPSA holders must assist UNDP in any disputes with third parties, and cooperate with audits conducted by the Office of Audit and Investigations or the Board of Auditors and/or investigations relating to matters on which the NPSA holders worked or have knowledge. Such assistance may include providing UNDP or its lawyers (or both) with information regarding an NPSA holder’s service, and serving as a witness in arbitration, conciliation, mediation and/or similar proceedings. Whether or not UNDP exercises such an option, an NPSA holder may not voluntarily or at the request of a third party, without being compelled to do so by relevant authorities, provide any assistance (other than serving, subject to the provisions of the NPSA regarding confidentiality, as an unremunerated fact witness) to the other party or parties to the dispute without the prior written consent of, or in the case of a request of relevant authorities, without notifying UNDP.      Professional Liability:   The NPSA holder shall be solely responsible for all claims arising out of or relating to their actions or omissions. NPSA holders are solely liable for claims by third parties arising from their own negligence and/or intentional acts or omissions committed during the exercise of their duties under the NPSA and must ensure that under no circumstances will UNDP be held liable for such claims.    NPSA holders must indemnify UNDP and its officials, agents, employees and contractors from and against all suits, proceedings, claims, demands, losses and liabilities of any kind or nature, including, but not limited to, all litigation costs and expenses, attorney fees, settlement payments and damages, based on, arising from, or relating to:   Allegations or claims that the use by UNDP of any device, any material or any other goods or services provided by the NPSA holder, in whole or in part, separately or in combination, constitutes an infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right of any third party; and  Allegations or claims that the NPSA holder during the term of the NPSA caused injury, loss or damage, whether physical, psychological and/or financial, to anyone who is not a party to the NPSA, including, without limitation, allegations and claims in the nature of a claim for workers’ compensation.     Compliance and working arrangements:  NPSA holders must adhere to the standards of conduct in the course of their official duties. NPSA holders involved in any action that is contrary to the Financial Regulations and Rules, or to organizational policies, or other prescriptive guidance may be held personally responsible and financially liable for the consequences arising therefrom.     NPSA holders must comply with all legislation, ordinances, rules, regulations, instruments, and other applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions (e.g., country of origin, country of residence, country (countries) where services are performed), including, but not limited to, those relating to taxation, licenses and work permits, as well as visas if required. Under no circumstances will UNDP be responsible for paying or reimbursing such taxes. NPSA holders must provide periodic proof of payment of taxes when requested to provide such proof by UNDP.   NPSA holders are responsible and must arrange for any necessary visa(s) and/or work permit(s) prior to assuming the NPSA. UNDP will not reimburse NPSA holders for visa and/or work permit fees incurred to assume the NPSA. However, if the NPSA holder is requested to undertake travel to other locations for UNDP, in which case any visa and/or work permit fees necessary for said other locations may be claimed through submission of a travel/expense claim and supporting documents.      NPSA holders may serve on corporate committees as may be permitted by the Terms of Reference of the respective committee. NPSA holders may not serve as chair, alternate chair or be the majority voting members on corporate committees.  Standards of Conduct     NPSA holders must comply with the standards of conduct set out in the UN Secretary General’s Bulletin of 9 October 2003, entitled “Special Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse” (ST/SGB/2003/13) and the UN Secretary-General’s Bulletin of 18 June 2002 entitled “Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission” (ST/SGB/2002/9) as they may be amended from time to time. Furthermore, NPSA holders must comply with all applicable UNDP administrative issuances. NPSA holders must also fully comply with all security policies, procedures and directives issued by UNDP.    Although NPSA holders are not staff members of the United Nations, while working on UNDP-related activities, they must comply with the standards of conduct required by the United Nations, except to the extent such standards are, in the opinion of UNDP, inherently inconsistent with their status as an NPSA holder.     Any breach of the NPSA will be grounds for immediate termination for cause, at the sole discretion of UNDP. If the NPSA holder is found by UNDP to have engaged in fraudulent, criminal or similar misconduct, UNDP may refer the matter to the relevant national authorities.   NPSA holders must cooperate fully and in good faith with any investigation conducted in accordance with UNDP’s Legal Framework for Addressing Non-compliance with United Nations Standards of Conduct” as well as any audit conducted by, or on behalf of, the Office of Audit and Investigations of UNDP or the UN Board of Auditors.    NPSA holders are bound by the terms of their NPSA to respect the impartiality and independence of the United Nations and UNDP and to exercise the utmost discretion in all matters relating to the performance of their assignment. During the period of service with UNDP, NPSA holders may not engage in any activity that is incompatible with the discharge of their duties with the organization. They should exercise utmost discretion in all matters of official activities of the organization.      Unless specifically set out in their NPSA and/or authorized in writing by the UNDP Administrator or his/her designate, NPSA holders should not communicate at any time to the media, or to any institution, person, government, or other external entity/authority any information that has not been made public and which has become known to them by reason of their association with UNDP, nor should they use such information for private advantage. These obligations will survive the expiration or termination of the NPSA.   An individual on NPSA may not engage in an outside professional activity (i.e. not for UNDP) whether remunerated or not, unless and only if the individual has received prior approval of UNDP to do so from the NPSA’s supervisor at UNDP.  Title Rights     UNDP will be entitled to all intellectual property and other proprietary rights, including, but not limited to, patents, copyrights and trademarks, with regard to products, processes, inventions, ideas, know-how or documents and other materials which the NPSA holder has developed for UNDP under the NPSA and which bear a direct relation to or are produced or prepared or collected in consequence of, or during the course of, the performance of the NPSA. The NPSA holder must acknowledge and agree that such products, documents and other materials constitute works made for hire for UNDP in the NPSA. However, to the extent that any such intellectual property or other proprietary rights consist of any intellectual property or other proprietary rights of the NPSA holder: (a) that pre-existed the performance by the NPSA holder of his/her obligations under the NPSA, or (b) that the NPSA holder may develop or acquire, or may have developed or acquired, independently of the performance of their obligations under the NPSA, UNDP does not and will not claim any ownership interest thereto, and the NPSA holder must grant to UNDP a perpetual license to use such intellectual property or other proprietary right solely for the purposes of and in accordance with the requirements of the NPSA. At the request of UNDP, the NPSA holder must take all necessary steps, execute all necessary documents and generally assist in securing such proprietary rights and transferring or licensing them to UNDP in compliance with the requirements of the applicable law and of the NPSA. Subject to the foregoing provisions, all maps, drawings, photographs, plans, reports, estimates, recommendations, documents and all data compiled by or received by the NPSA holder under the NPSA will be the property of UNDP, must be made available for use or inspection by UNDP, must be treated as confidential and must be delivered only to UNDP authorized officials on completion of work under the NPSA.  Nature of relationship between UNDP and the NPSA holder     NPSA holders are not and may not represent themselves as being an agent of UNDP. NPSA holders shall be solely responsible for all claims arising out of or relating to their actions or omissions.      Any disputes between the NPSA holder and UNDP will be subject to the dispute resolution mechanism in the NPSA General Terms and Conditions.          Duration of NPSA      An NPSA may be issued for any period from one day and up to a maximum of twelve months at a time, subject to the confirmation of available funding. The duration of the NPSA shall not, however, exceed the maximum duration of the project. The maximum period for the use of an NPSA is normally for the duration of the project and/or its expected funding period. Should an NPSA be required beyond four years under similar terms of reference and within the same project, a review of the function must be conducted and documented by the local HR focal point of the hiring business unit to reconfirm that the conditions of use of NPSA have not changed which would then reset the period for another four years. This cycle may be repeated as many times as may be needed, provided the functions performed continue to be under the conditions of when a NPSA may be used.    Due to its nature and purpose, the duration of the agreement has implications on benefits and entitlements package of each contract category. While regular NPSAs are expected to be of at least 6 months or longer in duration and provide for the set of benefits and entitlements, the short-term NPSAs less than 6 months (130 working days or less) will not have benefits and entitlements.      The NPSA carries no expectation of any future or other engagement with UNDP.    There may be specific instances where the need and intention are to issue a regular NPSA, but the current approved-budget periods are shorter than the minimum permissible duration of six months. In order to allow individuals to benefit from the Regular NPSA package and to facilitate the operational needs of the office, the policy provides the following options to the hiring units, provided the budget is expected to be extended beyond that:    Issue a Regular NPSA for a duration of less than six months noting the intention and the budget expectations, or  Issue a Regular NPSA for a duration of six months or more, with the expectation to foreshorten the NPSA should the budget not be sufficiently approved at the later stage (expectations are for both UNDP and the NPSA holder, including the potential bearing of the termination indemnity by the hiring unit).  Short-term NPSA on part-time may not exceed 6 months (or 130 working days) and can be issued for up to one year, provided that the short-term NPSA does not exceed 130 working days in any calendar year.    Functions: Support or Specialist Functions    An NPSA holder is an individual engaged by UNDP for a defined period of time, in the framework of the project to provide:    Support services such as administrative and related support. These types of services normally require technical knowledge acquired from a general academic education (secondary education) or from an apprenticeship or from training which may be specialized (e.g., finance, IT, procurement, etc.)  Specialist services such as expert advisory services, technical skills and/or knowledge services.  Specialist services are typically performed by a recognized specialist or authority in a specific field and the services performed are mainly of an intellectual and varied character. Performance of specialist services involves the regular and consistent exercise of discretion and judgment and the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be standardized in relation to a given period of time.   An NPSA holder may provide inputs to the performance evaluation of a staff member where the staff member’s terms of reference include functions of a technical nature, as may be determined by the Head of the Business Unit, or their designated representative.     Types of NPSAs: Regular and Short-term; Office- and Home-based     The below is a summary of the types of NPSA engagements depending on the needs of the business unit     NPSA agreements other than short-term agreements are referred to as “regular”. Regular NPSAs are to be used when services are required on a longer or more continuous basis throughout the project periods. Regular NPSAs are issued for up to a year at time and used on a continuous basis throughout the period of a minimum of six months continuously. Payments are made at the end of each calendar month.     NPSA agreements may be issued for up to a year at a time and used continuously or intermittently for up to a total of six months (130 working days) per calendar year and are considered a “Short-term” agreement. The NPSA recruited under a short-term agreement will specify a “unit price” (e.g., amount per hour, amount per translated page, etc.) For budgetary purposes, a monetary cap will be determined when the agreement is issued.     Additionally, any of the NPSA modalities may be used to engage someone on a home-based NPSA when they are not expected to work in any UNDP office or work location, or work is expected to be done on an intermittent basis only (i.e., the NPSA holder will mainly work away from a UNDP work location). The home-based status may be applied to regular NPSAs with a daily or monthly remuneration and to NPSAs issued as short-term, depending on the exigencies of the hiring business unit.   Engagement of Former and Retired UN Staff Members, and other Non-Staff Personnel    In the selection and engagement of NPSA holders, it is important to note that the engagement of candidates who currently work or have previously worked as UN staff members, or are retired UN staff members, is subject to special rules.      Staff members may not be separated for the sole purpose of immediately re-engaging them under an NPSA. Should a staff member wish to convert to an NPSA, and submit a motivated request in writing, UNDP may consider any such request, provided that it is compatible with the relevant terms of reference as well as the position structure and requirements. The Head of the Business Unit may make the determination on the functions. However, any such conversion must only be made in full consultation with the Bureau for Management Services’ Office of Legal Services (BMS/OLS). In such cases, a one-month break in service must occur between separation from the existing staff contract (Permanent Contract/Fixed-Term Appointment and the commencement of the NPSA.  A United Nations staff member who has separated may only enter into an NPSA with an effective starting date at least one (1) month after the effective separation date.     . Former staff and non-staff personnel may be recruited only after the expiration of such other contract. In no case may such other contract be foreshortened, i.e., terminated earlier, in order to allow such person to be engaged under an NPSA   Determining remuneration of Former or Retired Staff Members:    When a former staff member is engaged under an NPSA, the remuneration must not be based on the level of remuneration before separation, but rather on the nature and complexity of the assignment to be performed under the NPSA.      Former staff members in receipt of a UN pension benefit, may be engaged under NPSA only if:    The engagement represents both a cost-effective and a compliant solution to meet the service needs of the hiring business unit; A competitive process was carried out and is properly documented; The 30-day break in service requirement is met (not applicable to TAs); The former staff member in receipt of a UN pension benefit was not separated on grounds of disciplinary action or unsatisfactory performance; and, The individual is medically certified as fit.   The Head of the  Business Unit (as the term is defined below) must ensure that the remuneration of a UNDP (or UN and its funds and programmes) retiree does not exceed the limits set for those receiving a UNJSPF pension benefit.   Engagements of former staff in receipt of a UNJSPF pension benefit must not exceed the total duration of 6 months or total UN derived remuneration of USD 50,000 within one calendar year, which every comes first, and are non-renewable.   Engaging Close Relatives of UNDP Personnel     NPSA holders are subject to UNDP’s Policy on Family Relationships. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Head of the Business Unit must ensure at all times adherence to the requirements in the Staff Regulations and Rules relating to conflict of interest (refer to Staff Regulations and Rules 1.2 g m). If in doubt, cases should be communicated with the Ethics Office for support.  Authority for the Issuance of NPSAs     The authority to create any NPSA position, as well as the decision to award such a contract to the selected individual, is delegated and/or extended to the Resident Representative in Country Offices, and to the Bureau Director and UNV/UNCDF Executive Coordinator, and UNOSSC Director, or his/her Deputy for non-country office duty stations, if applicable (HQs, liaison offices, RSCs, policy centers etc).  NPSAs are issued and administered by UNDP’s GSSC.   Responsibility and Accountability      NPSA holders, like all other UNDP personnel, are accountable to the Administrator for the regularity of actions undertaken by them in the course of official duties. NPSA holders involved in any action that is contrary to the Financial Regulations and Rules, or to organizational policies, or other prescriptive guidance (i.e., the POPP) may be held personally responsible and financially liable for the consequences arising therefrom.   Responsibility for the correct and effective application and proper management of the NPSA policy and procedures, as well as the creation, issuance and management of individual NPSAs, is distributed to various roles in the organization, subject to oversight by Bureau for Management Services Office of Human Resources (BMS/OHR).  Responsibilities and roles are described in more detail under Section XXXIV of this policy.     UNDP, as the steward and utilization of public funds in its operations and administration, must use due care to ensure funds are utilized only for their intended purpose. Individuals holding a Delegation of Authority must be particularly careful to ensure actions undertaken by themselves or persons under their supervision are in compliance with the Financial Regulations and Rules, Programme and Operations Policies and Procedures (POPP), organizational directives, policies and prescriptive guidance applicable to UNDP.     Persons with delegated authority will be held accountable for the regularity of their actions relating to management of NPSAs in their respective business unit.      Classification & Established Scales   Classification:  The NPSA (Regular and Short-term) consists of several levels at which NPSA holders are recruited. The levels are established with broad reference to the local national grades and correspond to the methodology of UNDP classification. All NPSA Terms of Reference use UNDP’s competency framework, and positions are classified using the standards and frames of reference used within the UN system.   The following levels and classification scales are established:    Support: ICSC 1\t\t\tG1\t\tNPSA1 ICSC 2\t\t\tG2\t\tNPSA2 ICSC 3\t\t\tG3\t\tNPSA3 ICSC 4\t\t\tG4\t\tNPSA4 ICSC 5\t\t\tG5\t\tNPSA5 ICSC 6\t\t\tG6\t\tNPSA6 ICSC 7\t\t\tG7\t\tNPSA7  Officer: ICSC 8\t\t\tNOA\t\tNPSA8 ICSC 9\t\t\tNOB\t\tNPSA9  ICSC 10\t\t\tNOC\t\tNPSA10 ICSC 11\t\t\tNOD\t\tNPSA11 ICSC 12\t\t\tNOE\t\tNPSA12  Remuneration: After determining the classification level of the NPSA, the pay of NPSA is determined following the remuneration scale established in the duty station country. Please refer to Annex 2 for additional details.  Increments:  NPSA holders are eligible,  if their performance is deemed satisfactory, to receive an increment of renumeration of up to 3% of their then-current renumeration after continuous service of 12 consecutive months at their then-current NPSA level, provided, however, that the maximum remuneration with increments does not exceed the maximum remuneration of the band (refer to Annex 2).  Selection of NPSAs   UNDP Offices must comply with the principles of UNDP’s recruitment and selection framework, which include transparency and competitive selection, regardless of contract modality.  The different modalities for the selection of NPSAs are outlined in Annex 1 to this policy.  For regular NPSAs the modalities include: Competitive, via a Vacancy Announcement (VA); Using a candidate that has been pre-assessed in a previous competitive process at the same grade level, in the last 36 months; Direct selection from an HR or other approved Roster;  Lateral move from another NPSA position to a substantially similar role at the same level; and Direct selection upon approval of the Bureau Director.   In addition to the modalities listed in i), for short-term NPSAs, the modalities include: Direct selection from a procurement roster, i.e. GPN; Direct selection of an individual serving as an IC holder in 2021 or thereafter; and Review and assessment of candidate CVs/P11s.  For competitive recruitment processes, one or more assessment methods must be used. These can include, among others, panel interviews, tests, desk reviews, technical assessments.   Medical Clearance and Maximum Age for NPSAs  Individuals seeking engagement under an NPSA are responsible for providing certification of medical fitness to perform the functions they have applied for and/or have agreed to perform.    A medical certificate from a qualified physician is required, certifying that the mental and physical health of the individual is suitable for the performance of the duties and responsibilities, as well as the working environment in terms of location, and should be submitted by the individual prior to any contractual engagement. The cost of any medical examination necessary for the issuance of the medical certificate should be charged to the same source of funding as the NPSA itself.   The medical certification should be placed in the relevant file of the NPSA holder.     NPSA holders may be required, at any time, to undergo a medical examination when requested to do so to protect their health and safety, to follow-up on chronic health conditions, or to assess how a change in health circumstances since a prior certification might affect an NPSA holder’s capability to fulfill the functions for which they were contracted.    UNDP will not issue a regular NPSA to an individual above the age of 65 years. A regular NPSA may not be issued beyond the end of the month when the individual turns 65 years in age. For individuals on short-term NPSAs, there is no age limitation, provided that the individual is medically cleared and certified fit to work.  Part-time work     The hiring business unit may deem that the functions and activities appropriate for the NPSA modality may be performed on a part-time basis. The basic principle for establishing the pay f or part-time remuneration is that of pro-rating the pay from full-time pay for comparable work. For example, if an NPSA holder is engaged to work a four-day week (with normal working hours) the pay would be set at 80% of the pay for an NPSA with the same terms of reference on a full-time basis. Similarly, any other elements in the pay package (e.g., the organization’s portion of the subsidy for health insurance; group life and disability insurance etc. will be set at 80%) are to be pro-rated in the same manner. In the case of the danger allowance which is granted in recognition of the requirement to report to work under dangerous conditions and not necessarily the duration of the workday, the full amount is paid.     The precise working arrangements of the part-time work must be clearly specified in the agreement and understood by the NPSA holder and the immediate supervisor. Any change to the hours of work and pay must be made by an amendment to the agreement.   Contract Extension, Expiration and Termination   Extension of NPSA   If a decision is taken to extend an NPSA, it is an opportunity for the Hiring Unit to discuss and review the terms of reference, and whether any modifications are needed, bearing in mind that significant modification may require the signature of a new agreement altogether. Changes to more than two main functions are considered significant modifications and would require a new hiring process.   A regular NPSA can be renewed for periods between one day and up to one year at a time, in line with fund availability and suitability of performance.   Expiration of NPSA     NPSAs carry no expectation of renewal beyond its expiration date. Should the supervisor wish to extend the NPSA beyond its expiration date, a request for extension should be made, following communication with the NPSA holder and as early as possible before the expiration date of the NPSA.  In the event that a regular NPSA is not renewed, the supervisor must inform the operational units (HR/Finance/IT) at least one month before expiration of the NPSA to ensure that necessary actions are taken, e.g., recovery of any indebtedness to the organization, return of UNDP property such as computers/laptops, building access ID cards, keys, badges, etc. and release of final pay.   The UNDP Office may provide a letter of service upon request.   Termination of Contract & Termination indemnity    Either party may terminate a Regular NPSA before the expiry date of the contract by giving a minimum period of 30 calendar days’ notice in writing to the other party (NPSA holder and Hiring Manager).     BMS/OLS must be consulted prior to the termination of an NPSA by UNDP, unless mutually agreed to in writing by both the NPSA holder and the UNDP Office involved.  In the event that the contract is terminated the NPSA holder is entitled to a termination indemnity equivalent to one month of net pay, in addition to the minimum required notice period.    If UNDP terminates the NPSA for cause (i.e., as a result of violation of the standards of conduct or breach of other material terms of the NPSA), the NPSA holder will not be entitled to either a period of notice or other compensation, and will not be eligible for any future contract or engagement of any type.     No compensation or termination indemnity payment shall be made if the NPSA holder terminates the NPSA, or upon the natural expiration of the NPSA.   The Head of the Business Unit must terminate the NPSA in the following circumstances:    abandonment of functions, i.e., when the NPSA holder is absent from duty without approval for more than five consecutive days;  violation of the standards of conduct or other material terms of the contract in the NPSA, including, but not limited to, acts of fraud or misrepresentation;  in the event of unsatisfactory performance, where the Head of the Business Unit should consult with BMS/OHR and BMS/OLS before deciding whether to terminate the contract.     There is zero tolerance for acts of fraud and violations of the standards of conduct, and any such suspicions must be referred to OAI for review, and if the NPSA holder is found to have engaged in these acts, the Business Unit, after consultation with BMS/OLS, is expected to terminate the agreement. Advice must be sought from BMS/OLS prior to taking any decision on such an action.   Recourse/Settlement of disputes    In the event of any dispute arising out of the NPSA, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the conditions set out in the NPSA on dispute settlement.    Hiring offices/managers should consult and seek the advice of BMS/OLS in cases involving issues of breach of contract, and report to the Office of Audit and Investigations, including cases where misconduct is involved.     NPSA holders can report workplace issues as follows:    allegations of workplace harassment, sexual harassment and abuse of authority, through harassment.support@undp.org; or   Allegations of fraud of mismanagement of UNDP funds through reportmisconduct@undp.org   Further details and information can be found under the ‘Accountability’ section on UNDP’s website.  Such allegations must be reported in good faith and with substantiating and detailed information and documentation. Reporting may also be done anonymously, and NPSAs are equally protected by UNDP’s Protection against Retaliation Policy.    Overtime (applicable to regular NPSAs only)  While overtime work is generally discouraged, situations arise when it is necessary for individuals engaged under a NPSA to work more than the established work hours. In such cases overtime pay may only be applied to NPSA 1 to NPSA 7 levels and must not exceed 40 hours per month; NPSA holders engaged at levels higher than NPSA 7 are not eligible for overtime pay.  The conditions governing the rate and disbursement of overtime pay are those applicable to locally recruited general service staff in UNDP’s Overtime policy.   Overtime pay must be requested and approved by the supervisor in advance of the extra work period to be performed, subject to the availability of funds.  The cost of overtime pay must be funded from the same source as the NPSA itself. UNDP Offices must ensure that sufficient funds exist for functions that may reasonably expect payment of overtime.  Overtime pay must be monitored closely and kept to a minimum.   Danger Allowance    In addition to the base monthly remuneration, NPSA holders who serve in locations where danger pay is receivable by staff are entitled to a Danger Allowance.     The Danger Allowance is payable based on presence at the duty station. NPSA holders on parental leave, annual or sick leave continue to be eligible as long as they remain in the duty station. The Danger Allowance is also payable for time away from the designated duty station on official duty travel up to a maximum of seven consecutive calendar days including weekends and holidays falling during that period. Payment ceases from the eighth day of official duty travel. If the NPSA holder’s travel on mission to another location that qualifies for Danger Allowance, they will receive Danger Allowance at the rate of that location if their travel exceeds a full month continuously.     Danger Allowance is not payable for days spent away from the duty station on annual leave or any type of special leave.     For NPSA holders who spend one complete month in the area where the Danger Allowance is applicable, the monthly sum is paid as a lump sum, irrespective of the number of days in the month at the rate established at the duty station. For remaining periods of less than one month within the continuous travel period, the amount of Danger Allowance is pro-rated on the basis of 365 days; the daily rate is calculated by dividing the annual amount by the number of days actually spent at the duty station during that remainder of a month. Danger Allowance is payable in increments of one full day and is not prorated on an hourly basis.    NPSA Remuneration Advances   NPSA holders may request remuneration advances in emergency situations, provided the project duration, the contract duration and the availability of funding cover the amount and the intended period of repayment. In the event that remuneration advances are approved by the supervisor, the same conditions of request and repayment shall apply as for staff   salary advances.    Mandatory subsidized coverage not commutable to cash  The following subsidized coverage is provided by UNDP and is mandatory to cover possible risks against the individual or the organization. These benefits may not be commuted to cash and are mandatory and applicable as stated below.    Group Life and Disability Insurance (applicable to regular NPSAs)   All eligible persons hired on an NPSA will be covered for service incurred disability/injury/death, at no cost to the NPSA holder.    NPSA holders must be enrolled in the global corporate scheme for life and disability insurance prescribed by UNDP and which provides cover for death and permanent disability as a result of any cause. In the event of death and disability as a result of any cause, a claim must be submitted under the scheme for compensation through the service provider.    The premium for the scheme must be paid by the UNDP Office in respect of each Regular NPSA holder. The premium is established in US dollars. The local currency value must be determined monthly on the basis of the UN operational rate of exchange. The premium must be collected and remitted monthly at the time of processing the remuneration.    The UNDP Office must maintain a record in QUANTUM of amounts collected, should there be any questions or audit at a later date.    For this premium amount, subject to the service provider policies in place, the NPSA holder would be eligible to receive up to the ceiling established under this benefit for permanent total disability and, in the event of the NPSA holder’s death, the surviving spouse and/or dependents would receive up to the ceiling established under this benefit.    Claims for Death or Disability:    In the event of death of an NPSA holder, the UNDP Office must promptly notify the insurance company. Information surrounding the death, contractual status and other documentation must be provided by the UNDP Office as requested by the insurance company.   In the event of a service incurred disability which prevents the NPSA holder from continuing to perform according to their contract, a claim can be submitted under the corporate scheme for group service-incurred death and disability for compensation through the service provider, or under the local scheme established by the UNDP Office.    Each UNDP Office must ensure it has a copy of the policy on file since the claim procedure is set forth therein. The current certification required by the service provider for settlement of death, service-incurred injury or disability claims is:     a report from the UN examining physician;  evidence of valid contract at the time of death or disability; and  an indication that the premiums have been paid throughout the contract.     The UNDP Office must have on file the original entry medical report, should there be any question regarding the medical condition of the NPSA holder.   Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP) (applicable to regular NPSAs)   NPSA holders who serve at, or travel at UNDP ’s expense to, a designated hazardous duty station are automatically covered by the Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP) and must therefore be included within established security arrangements in the Security Plan locally. Failure to comply with security instructions may render the insurance coverage null and void in so far as it relates to the NPSA holder in question. Furthermore, non-compliance with security instructions is grounds for termination of the NPSA for cause. The UNDP Office must therefore ensure that the information on MAIP and the relevant security instructions are available to NPSA holders.    All claims, together with supporting documentation, must be submitted by the NPSA holder to the local Human Resources Administrator, who is responsible for reviewing such claims and forwarding them to the HR Advisor at Headquarters serving the duty station in question.   Medical Evacuation  Individuals engaged under NPSA are not eligible for medical evacuation unless they are on official travel status outside the duty station. However, the UNDP office may, at its discretion, facilitate the medical evacuation in cases of an emergency nature, where the service exists and is able to cater for such, and where the local health services are inadequate and the NPSA holder requests the assistance of UNDP. The cost for such medical evacuation shall be borne by the NPSA holder. The NPSA holder must be provided with advance notice and agree in writing to pay the full cost of the medical evacuation.   Under the global group life, disability & medical insurance plan, in the case of emergency or major disability the cost of special transportation of an insured NPSA holder from the first place where the NPSA holder is injured or stricken by a disease to the first hospital where treatment is given, is covered up to the ceiling established under this benefit. If the NPSA holder is enrolled under the corporate plan for medical coverage, the CO must inform the service provider when a medical evacuation takes place to facilitate guidance and support.   Mandatory subsidized coverage that is commutable to cash in lieu of coverage (applicable to Regular NPSAs only)  Medical Insurance  UNDP provides coverage for medical insurance to all its regular NPSAs through a contract with a service provider. In exceptional cases, NPSAs may choose at the start of the NPSA, or within permissible entry windows between two options for their coverage:  Standard corporate scheme through service provider, provided through UNDP and administered directly by UNDP; or Maintaining a pre-existing medical scheme of coverage, not provided through UNDP and administered directly by the NPSA holder.  In the case that the standard corporate coverage is used, the premium is established in US dollars. The local currency value must be determined monthly on the basis of the UN operational rate of exchange. The premium must be collected and remitted monthly at the time of processing the remuneration in order to have coverage. Only the premium for the NPSA holder is subsidized by UNDP.  UNDP does not subsidize medical insurance for the NPSA holder’s recognized dependents. The NPSA holder may choose to enroll dependents recognized by UNDP within 30 days of the starting date of their NPSA, provided the NPSA holder pays the full premium for them. These premiums are collected by means of a payroll deduction every month.          Individual NPSA holders may in exceptional cases remain in a pre-existing medical scheme, whether through previous employment, a spouse or other source, or through direct contribution to an existing national medical scheme. In such cases, UNDP provides a cash amount to cover the premium of the pre-existing scheme or existing national medical scheme as part of the monthly remuneration, provided there is proof of coverage and the amount does not exceed the monthly fee amount for UNDP’s standard corporate coverage. The individual must present proof of participation and coverage at the commencement of the NPSA, and takes full responsibility for their own coverage and administration of that coverage. The UNDP Office is responsible for verifying that the individual has adequate coverage. The NPSA holder must notify the UNDP Office of any change in coverage during the term of the NPSA. The payment of cash for medical insurance, without the individual having coverage, is not permitted.   UNDP Offices are responsible for ensuring that no NPSA holder travels on UNDP mission travel outside the country of residence without arranging medical coverage under the corporate or other local private scheme for the duration of the mission, at no cost to the NPSA holder.    Social Security and Pension Fund Arrangements  NPSA holders must comply with any national social security obligations applicable to them, and UNDP takes no responsibility for ensuring that they do so. Such coverage shall be in place from signature of the NPSA by UNDP and the NPSA holder.   UNDP will pay NPSA holders a lump sum amount in addition to their remuneration equivalent to 8.33% of their pay in lieu of pension fund and all other social security obligations.  NPSA holders are responsible to ensure that they enroll themselves into any scheme of their choice, and that the monthly payments are made directly between them and the service provider.  NPSA holders do not need to submit any proof or evidence of enrolment or payments.  UNDP will not engage directly with any pension scheme service provider, nor will pay any service provider directly, unless it is not possible for individuals to make direct payments other than through the office.  In countries where a national social security scheme exists, individuals under NPSA are expected to contribute directly to such a scheme. UNDP has no obligation to contribute directly to the national scheme, as it cannot be subject to any national scheme.  By signing the NPSA, the NPSA holder agrees to a ‘No Contest’ (attached as Annex 9) that confirms agreement to receive the pension contribution in the form of a lump sum.   Optional coverage provided, but not subsidized by UNDP   UNDP may make available a range of optional benefits and coverages to be accessed by individuals directly and at their own expense. Any such benefits will be made available through agreements concluded by UNDP and service providers, and incur no corporate liability for the organization, only making these services available for the direct benefit and at the full cost and responsibility of the NPSA holder.   Working Hours   The working hours, UN official holidays and weekends for regular NPSA holders are aligned with those applicable to staff and other personnel in the duty station.        Leave   Annual leave:    NPSA holders with regular NPSAs are eligible for paid annual leave of two and a half working days per month, which may be accumulated during the contract period, as specified below.   All annual leave is expected to be taken within the period of the NPSA agreement. If the NPSA agreement is extended for an additional period and funded from the same funding source/project, the NPSA may carry over accrued annual leave to the subsequent contract period. As of the annual leave cut-off date of 1 April of any given year, the annual leave balance (if any) will be re-set to a maximum of 24 days.   Unused paid annual leave is not commutable to cash unless it is approved and/or requested by the supervisor, for example, when the presence of the NPSA holder is required to perform their functions prior to separation within the notice period given, and where the budget is able to cater for this payment and charged fully to the current budget period of the funding source. A maximum  of twenty-four (24) annual leave days may be commuted to cash.  Any absence from duty not specifically authorized, including any absence beyond the allowable time-off in accordance with this policy, will be treated as unauthorized absence and must be charged to unpaid leave.    Sick Leave:    Eligible individuals holding Regular NPSAs who are unable to perform their duties because of illness or injury or whose attendance at work is prevented by public health requirements shall be granted sick leave in accordance with the terms of their NPSA.   Regular NPSA holders shall accrue credits towards sick leave at the rate of two working days for each month of service up to a maximum of 31 days (24 certified and 7 uncertified), or at the rate applied as per local practice, whichever is higher. Of those sick leave days accrued, a total of seven working days in an annual cycle starting 1 April of any year (subject to a maximum of two consecutive working days) may be taken as sick leave without providing a medical certificate from a duly recognized medical practitioner; or for family-related emergencies and/or obligations, such as in the event of a death in the NPSA holder’s immediate family or to take care of his/her child or an immediate family member who becomes ill.   Any absence supported by a medical certificate from a certified medical practitioner shall be considered as certified sick leave. The sick leave certificate from a certified medical practitioner must state that the individual is unable to perform his or her duties indicating the probable duration of the illness. In the event that the NPSA holder fails to provide the required supporting documents, the absence shall be charged to annual leave. Should the annual leave be exhausted, the absence shall be deducted from remuneration accordingly.   Medical reports must not be shared with non-authorized medical professionals including supervisors and heads of business unit.   NPSA holders must inform their supervisor of absences due to illness or injury on the same day of absence, except in emergency situations where the NPSA holder is unable to communicate this absence.    Eligible NPSA holders may, in exceptional circumstances, be granted advanced sick leave up to a maximum of ten working days, provided that his/her service under the NPSA is expected to continue for the period that is necessary to accrue the sick leave days so advanced.   Certified sick leave shall be recorded in units of full days and/or half-days.   In the event that the NPSA is extended for an additional period under the same terms of reference, the individual may carry over unused sick leave credits to the subsequent NPSA up to a maximum of 31 days. Sick leave credits will stop accruing when an NPSA holder has a balance of 31 unused sick leave days.   An individual who is sick for more than five working days in any seven-day period while on annual leave and/or hardship leave, shall have that portion of his or her absence considered as sick leave upon presentation of satisfactory medical certification.   Sick leave shall not be granted instead of parental leave.   Unused sick leave credits are not commutable to cash.   An NPSA holder may be required at any time to submit a medical report in relation to a health condition or to undergo a medical examination by a certified medical practitioner at the request of the Head of the Business Unit. Costs of the medical report will be reimbursed by UNDP, unless such an exam is covered by an insurance.    The termination of a contract shall, from the date it is effective, terminate any possibility to claim sick leave credits.   In the event that an individual surpasses the sick leave credits limit during the contract period, the excess period will be charged against accrued annual leave. Should the annual leave be exhausted, the NPSA holder may be played on special leave without pay, otherwise any further absence shall be deducted from the remuneration accordingly.   If the individual is not eligible for paid sick leave, managers should exercise the highest possible degree of flexibility in accepting unpaid leave due to illness. Only in such cases where the extent or timing of absences prevents the individual from delivering the services as specified in the terms of reference may the manager consider a termination of the contract due to illness.  Computation of Annual and Sick Leave   When the contract start date falls on the 1st of the month: Full leave entitlements  When the contract start date falls between the 2nd and the 16th of the month: two days annual leave and one day sick leave for that calendar month.   When the contract start date falls on the 17th of the month or later: one day annual leave and one day sick leave for that calendar month.   When the contract end date falls between the 1st and the 16th of the month: one day annual leave and one day sick leave for that calendar month.   When contract end date falls on the 17th of the month or later, but not on the last day of the month: two days annual leave and one day sick leave.  Part-time NPSAs will have their starting and ending annual and sick leave totals pro-rated to reflect their part-time schedule.    Parental Leave (for birth parent):   NPSA holders on regular NPSAs are entitled to 16 consecutive weeks of paid parental leave for the birth parent.   Extensions of parental leave for birth parents may be granted on the basis of unpaid leave, regardless of contract durations for regular NPSAs.  Parental leave for the birth parent must fall within and be taken during the contract period. Where the parental leave started during the contract period, but the contract is due to expire during the period of the parental leave, the contract will be extended for the purpose of covering the full 16-week duration of the parental leave. There is no expectation or obligation to extend beyond the above extension to accommodate for parental leave for the birth parent if the original position was not envisaged to be longer. No leave will be accumulated during the extended period.    Individuals must submit the request for parental leave at least three months prior to the anticipated start date and the request should be accompanied by a certification from a doctor or midwife stating the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD).   Parental leave for birth parents must begin between two and six weeks prior to EDD and be taken in one consecutive period.   Annual leave will accrue during the period of parental leave.   Time-off to breast feed infants up to two years old: The UNDP standard policy applies.   Parental Leave (for non-birth parent)   NPSA holders on regular NPSAs are eligible for four weeks of paid parental leave.  Parental leave for non-birth parents may be taken in either one or two fixed periods during the first 12 months from the birth of their child.   NPSA holders must submit their request for parental leave within a reasonable period of not less than two weeks prior to the expected start of the parental leave, in agreement with the supervisor, and the request should be accompanied by a certification from a doctor or midwife stating the EDD to be followed by a copy of the child’s birth certificate.  Parental leave for non-birth parents is limited to one occurrence per 12 months, regardless of the number of children born during that 12-month period.   Parental leave for non-birth parents must fall within and be taken during the contract period. Unused parental leave is not commutable to cash. The contract must not be extended solely in order to exercise the unused portion of the parental leave.    Unpaid Leave:   In emergency situations, the Head of the Business Unit may exercise flexibility in allowing unpaid leave at the NPSA holder’s request for up to 12 months, subject to exigencies of service, for individuals who have been on a continuous NPSA for at least 36 months.  In conjunction with parental leave of birth parents, NPSA holders may also be eligible for unpaid leave immediately following the parental leave for up to eight additional months. The 36-month eligibility stated above does not apply in such a case.  The Head of a Business Unit may also exercise at their own decision to apply unpaid leave to an individual on NPSA without any notice period. Such decisions should only be made in cases or serious breach or identified conflict of interest, or of similar seriousness, and only in full consultation with the Office of Legal services and/or Ethics Office.   Unpaid leave shall not be granted until paid leave provisions, when applicable, have been exhausted.    Unpaid leave must be approved in advance by the supervisor and Head of the Business Unit.   Unpaid leave will normally only be allowed in the following circumstances:    In connection with parental leave;  In relation to illness;  In relation to family/personal reasons; and similar emergency situations   For deployment or assignment to another office within UNDP, academic research, lecturing or advancement of a relevant expertise through special trainings.     Annual leave will not accrue during unpaid leave periods of 30 days or longer.   Except when unpaid leave is taken in connection to certified sick leave, health and life insurance coverage during periods of unpaid leave of 30 days or longer, is discontinued or paid directly by the NPSA holder.  Jury Duty, Other Appearances in Court and Military Service:   NPSA holders serving on jury duty will be granted leave with pay by the relevant Head of the Business Unit up to a maximum of five working days in a calendar year, in units of full or half days as certified by the court.   Court appearances at UNDP’s request should be recorded as absence on official business.   Court appearances as a party in the NPSA holder’s personal capacity and not at the request of UNDP will be charged to annual leave or unpaid leave.   For court appearances as a witness in the NPSA holder’s personal capacity, the heads of business units shall decide whether the absence is to be charged to annual leave or special paid or unpaid leave, according to the circumstances of the case.   NPSA holders may be granted unpaid leave for military training or service required by their government at the discretion of the Head of the Business Unit.   Leave Provisions on Contract Extension:   When an NPSA of an initial duration of less than six months is subsequently extended to reach or exceed six months for continuous use of the NPSA holder, provisions for annual leave and sick leave will start to apply subject to the eligibility as specified in this policy, from the effective date of the contract extension. Leave is not accumulated retroactively.     Time off for Voting in Elections:   NPSA holders wishing to exercise their right to vote on election days should try to do so outside their normal working hours. Those who are unable to do so should request up to two hours of time off from their Head of the Business Unit. However, upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that voting may take longer, the Heads of Business Units may grant up to four hours of time off subject to the exigencies of service.    Hardship Leave:   NPSA holders are not entitled to Hardship Leave.  Travel for Work  Travel for work outside the country of duty station shall always be in economy class for NPSA holders, regardless of travel time. Travel arrangements shall follow the regular procedures as established for corporate travel and are to comply with provisions of the Security Clearance policy. DSA is paid regularly during travel for work outside the country of duty station as per the corporate travel policy.  Detail Assignments   Regular NPSAs are eligible for detail assignments, provided that the requirements of both the releasing and receiving offices, as well as their host countries allow for that, and that the individual is adequately covered with health insurance while on assignment abroad. This eligibility does not apply to non-residents of NY HQs-based G-level personnel.     Performance Evaluation   Service monitoring and performance evaluation are mandatory for regular NPSA holders as part of a process to be carried out by supervisors in order to provide regular feedback about individual performance and progress achieved against agreed terms of reference, as well as set objectives and results. The performance of the NPSA holder must be communicated to the NPSA throughout the duration of the NPSA.    In this context, the purpose of the Performance Evaluation is to:    Review progress against agreed upon terms of reference and set objectives;  Provide feedback on the performance of the individual NPSA holder; and  Make informed decisions on contractual matters (extension, non-renewal).    For regular NPSA holders, a full- service evaluation report must be completed, using the online PMD platform for any service period exceeding six months worked during that evaluation year. Where the PMD platform is not available or for short-term NPSA holders, the NPSA Service Evaluation form in Annex 5 can be used.    For short-term NPSA holders, or for periods of service of less than six months, only section I of the NPSA Service Evaluation form is completed and should be documented as a note to file.      Each Service Evaluation form must be filed for record keeping by the human resources focal point of the Business Unit, or online when available.    Learning Opportunities (applicable to Regular NPSAs only)   All regular NPSA holders must complete any applicable corporate and mandatory training courses within the required time established by UNDP.   NPSA holders will have access to learning and development opportunities available to UNDP personnel, including access to formal programmes (in line with the target audiences and requirements established for such programmes), on-demand learning resources, and the UNDP learning management system/platform(s).   The proforma cost of the NPSA will include a contribution to the UNDP corporate Learning Reserve to enable NPSA holders’ access to the initiatives funded from the Learning Reserve and resources that are offered to UNDP personnel at no cost. Any additional costs related to the participation in the UNDP corporate learning and development programmes and other relevant costs will be charged to the funding source(s) of the respective NPSA holders.   NPSA holders may be requested to take part in the specific training or professional certification programmes, if necessary or required by UNDP.    Career Paths, lateral moves, status as candidates (applicable to regular NPSAs only)  Regular NPSA holders will have access to career opportunities within UNDP as well as to the career development resources available to all UNDP personnel, subject to eligibility requirements specific to the functions. As such and subject to eligibility, they will be able to apply for UNDP staff positions and job opportunities under other contractual modalities, in line with UNDP recruitment and selection framework, and the requirements of the respective positions and offers.   NPSA holders who have served a minimum of three years with UNDP and have demonstrated successful performance, as recorded in the formal performance reviews, will be eligible to participate in the corporate talent pool assessments and similar initiatives as internal candidates, subject to meeting the relevant eligibility requirements. All NPSA holders will be able to participate in such initiatives, when open to external candidates.  NPSAs shall not be considered internal candidates for vacancy announcements that have been categorized as internal, regardless of time spent on NPSA contracts.  Roles and Responsibilities  Heads of Business Units / Responsible Officers (Heads of Offices):    Heads of Business Unit (incl. Resident Representatives, HQs units, UNV Executive Coordinator, or other individuals delegated authority hereunder) are designated as Responsible Offices, responsible for enforcing the terms of this policy and are accountable for decisions taken. Directors must consider the performance of the Responsible Officers in managing the NPSA in accordance with this policy, e.g. Audit Reports and BMS/OHR reports may be used as a reference for evaluation.     Responsible Officers:   defining clear terms of reference with measurable outputs, timelines, and indicating qualifications and competencies required determining the use of NPSA as the appropriate contractual modality and adhering to the requirements of this policy  ensuring availability of funds for the duration of the NPSA and extension  contracting the most qualified candidate in a transparent and competitive manner; and  service monitoring and evaluation, recommendation for level of payment and NPSA extensions.  exercising delegation of authority on the issuance of NPSAs   ensuring that a transparent and competitive selection process is instituted for NPSAs in their respective office  monitoring the transparency and competitive selection process for NPSAs in their respective office  managing the conflict resolution process in accordance with the NPSA and in consultation with BMS/OLS and the BMS/OHR Policy Unit as set forth in this policy Setting the remuneration scales in country offices, incl. NIM scales where applicable.   The Local BU HR Focal Point & GSSC:    Before issuing an NPSA, the Human Resources Focal Points must ensure that the policy is complied with and that the NPSA template is used for contracting  services of the individual. No deviations to the model NPSA template can be made without consultation with, and clearance of, BMS/OHR and BMS/OLS. The local BU is responsible for classifying short-term NPSAs.   \t GSSC Focal Points are responsible for: coordinating and administering the recruitment process coordinating the contracting process of the candidates;  issuing the NPSA including the applicable conditions of service; Management of NPSAs in the corporate ERP; ensuring payment of monthly remuneration according to terms of NPSA;  ensuring that adequate insurance provisions are in place;  maintaining a roster of candidates in the various categories; and  maintaining records for monitoring and reporting purposes.    NPSAs are paid through UNDP’s GSSC/Global Payroll.      BMS/OHR Business Partners:    BMS/OHR Business Partners are responsible for providing advisory support and guidance in the administration and application of NPSAs.    Office of Audit and Investigation (OAI):    OAI will audit the use of NPSAs by the UNDP Offices and report on its findings at any time OAI deems necessary.    Oversight, Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting:    The Responsible Officers, Business Partners, GSSU and the respective HR Focal Point(s) should use the information available in the corporate (ERP) database to act on their respective responsibility for oversight, monitoring and / or evaluation on the use of NPSAs. These include the use of data for, among others, succession planning, contract extensions, as well as monitoring of the performance of their respective business units against corporate indicators, such as gender ratios.  Organizational score cards or benchmarks will be established by BMS/OHR on a periodic basis to ensure the reporting, monitoring and evaluation of the use of NPSAs.   National Implementation Programmes (NIM):  In countries with programmes that fall formally under the Support Services of UNDP to National Implementation (NIM), and where alignment to the set standards of benefits and entitlements of the national implementation partners is deemed necessary, UNDP Resident Representatives may apply flexibilities outside the regular NPSA parameters in the following areas, provided that systems and internal UNDP procedures allow for such flexibilities to be practically applied, that the risks and liabilities related to these benefits and entitlements are formally covered by the national implementation partner, and provided that these benefits and entitlements fulfill the minimum national standards of the country in which the programme is being nationally implemented:  When UNDP issues the agreement, NPSA holders hired under a National implementation modality, remain under the administrative supervision of UNDP, even if daily supervision is ensured by the national counterpart;   Alternative remuneration scales may be promulgated by the Resident Representative of the country office to be used specifically for NPSAs that fall under the NIM. A NIM-specific remuneration scale shall follow the same principles used to construct the regular NPSA scale for the country, and applied across all the NPSA levels under the NIM project(s) subject to the NIM-specific remuneration scale in that country. The level and the suggested remuneration rate may also be set by the national implementation partner if the agreement clearly allows for it;  Annual increments may align to the practice of the national implementation partner;  Performance evaluation: If the NPSA holder is supervised by the national implementation partner, the performance evaluation can follow the same format and procedure used by the national implementation partner. UNDP should maintain a copy of the evaluation for its records;  Working schedules and official holidays can be aligned to those of the national implementation partner;  Leave entitlements:  Leave entitlements can be aligned with the standards applicable to the national implementation partner;   Pension schemes: Similarly, payments in lieu of pension may be adjusted to those of the national partner;  Official Travel: Official travel shall follow the standards and policies of the national partner, including class of travel as well as daily subsistence allowances;  Security costs: Where the NPSA holder is covered by and falls under the security scheme coverage of the national partners, they shall be exempted from the UN security plans and security costs otherwise applicable to UNDP NPSAs will not be applied, and the NPSA holder will be so notified; and  Normally the mandatory insurance coverages which are otherwise applicable as a standard for UNDP NPSAs, will apply, any exceptions must be agreed to by GSSC, in consultation with the BMS/OHR/Policy and Compensation unit.   In situations where the NIM personnel are contracted directly by the national implementation entity, and where such personnel contracts are also signed by that national implementation entity, UNDP may support in sharing advice and good practices on standards, templates and tools. The accountability and decision to use and/or apply such standards shall be solely that of the national implementation entity.   Annexes:    Annex 1 – Recruitment standards and procedures for NPSAs. Annex 2: Remuneration Scales, Classification Bands, and Setting the Remuneration for NPSAs Annex 3 – Overview of NPSA benefits  Annex 4 – Definition of inherent and continuous nature of functions  Annex 5 – Performance Evaluation  Annex 6 – Checklist of inclusions in NPSA file  Annex 7 – Equipment and Supplies  Annex 8 – Transitional Measures – Rollout of the new remuneration scale Annex 9 – Certificate of No-Contest          Annex 1: Recruitment standards and procedures for NPSAs   For the selection of NPSAs, the selection process must adhere to the general principles listed in the UNDP’s Recruitment and Selection Framework Policy to ensure that the person selected is the best-qualified candidate to perform the job functions in a fully satisfactory manner. These principles are:  Competition: Selection will follow a visible and fair competitive process for all vacancies, regardless of post, contractual modality or hiring unit;  Objectivity: Screening will be conducted with professional rigor, with candidates measured against clearly articulated criteria, job skills and competencies and corporate priorities;  Transparency: The recruitment and selection criteria and all phases of recruitment processes will be transparent to candidates to the fullest extent possible;  Diversity: UNDP’s workforce will reflect diversity and will strive to include equal numbers of men and women, and individuals from under-represented groups, indigenous groups and persons with disabilities;  Non-Discrimination: UNDP will not discriminate in its recruitment and selection processes on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, family status or disability; and  Accountability: Hiring managers will be held accountable both for their selection proposals and the manner in which they have followed the processes leading up to them.  Other fundamental conditions:  Residency Requirements: Depending on the duty station, certain specific residency requirements may be applicable before an offer of a national personnel services agreement is made. Generally, it is expected that candidates will either: i) be nationals or permanent residents of the country where the NPSA position is being offered; or ii) having the proper documentation allowing the NPSA holder to legally work in that country.  Recruitment of Government Personnel: Any candidate who is a government employee must disclose this relationship prior to being engaged on an NPSA. As a rule, candidates who are employed by a government or a government entity are expected to resign from said employment upon acceptance of an NPSA with UNDP. In cases where candidates continue to be employed or affiliated with a government institution or other authority external to UNDP, they must provide evidence that they have been accorded special leave without pay, or a similar status, from their employer prior to being engaged under a NPSA. Notwithstanding the disclosure, the individual engaged under an NPSA Service Contract is bound by the principle of impartiality as specified in the agreement.  Obligation of Confidentiality: Everyone who is involved in a selection process, in one capacity or another (e.g. long-listing, short-listing, interview panel, etc.) must engage in these such activities maintaining strict confidentiality. A selection process is not completed until all the different selection, review and clearance steps have been taken. It is therefore expected that no information be shared with the candidates or others not involved in the selection process until the final approval for the selection has been signed    Selection Modalities and Procedures:     Unless a competitive selection is considered not practicable, each recruitment and selection must include the following:  i)  Vacancy announcement of a budgeted and classified NPSA post; ii) Competitive, job-specific objective assessment of skills and competencies as well as a competitive assessment of corporate values and ethics.  A thorough verification of relevant qualifications and credentials, including thorough reference checks must be completed in every case.   A. Selection by competitive process     A competitive recruitment process is the standard procedure for recruiting regular NPSAs.   To ensure competitiveness, the shortlist must be comprised of at least two candidates, but ideally three or more. At least one woman should be included on the short-list. If no female candidate is included on the short-list, the Hiring Unit must document the efforts that have been made to identify qualified female candidates including re-advertisement. Where only one qualified candidate has been identified, the Hiring Unit must document the efforts that have been made to identify additional candidates, and secure approval from the OHR Business Partner before proceeding further.   For short-term NPSAs, an assessment and review of the profiles or CVs at least two qualifying candidates is required and should be documented and presented to the Head of the Business Unit for their selection decision.   B. Direct recruitment of a previously assessed candidate  This option allows offices to hire a candidate who has been assessed through a competitive process for the same job function and level, and who has passed the threshold in a previous recruitment process completed within the previous 36 months.   Individuals who had previously been assessed for similar positions and had passed the threshold but were ranked below the candidate selected within the past 36 months, may be placed on an HR roster. Hiring managers should preferably interview the individual to ascertain that the individual is interested in the position and to reconfirm their suitability.     A hiring unit may also transfer an NPSA Holder from one project or position to another in the same duty station with identical functions, and the same band/level and remuneration, without a new competitive process, provided that the candidate has a satisfactory performance record. In such instances a new NPSA contract must be issued. It must also be noted that by doing so, the time of service of the NPSA holder is not reset in such case, if there is no break between the contracts.      For the purposes of this Policy, “similar position” shall mean a position under the same contract modality (NPSA), grade and band with two or less changes to the stated functions.     C. Direct recruitment from a roster that has been formally recognized by UNDP   UNDP business units may also use a roster of pre–assessed candidates, in accordance with locally established roster procedures without having to go through a full process outlined in Section A. above. The selection from the roster remains subject to the approval of the Head of the hiring Business Unit.    Where one or more suitable candidates is/are identified by the Head of the Business Unit, the remuneration to be offered will be calculated by the unit using the remuneration setting tool as relevant to the role described in the TORs and the duty station.    In such cases, a review or assessment process is not necessary. The recommendation and the criteria must be documented.    For certain roles, UNDP may access formally established personnel rosters of other UN, recognized multi-lateral international organizations and International Financial Institutions (IFI) to source suitable personnel. It is at the Hiring Manager’s discretion to select external partner personnel, through the clearance of the Regional HR Business Partner.     D. Direct selection of a candidate    The UNDP Administrator, Associate Administrator or their delegates (RB Directors and Deputies, UNV or UNCDF Executive Coordinator, and UNOSSC Director) may hire a candidate on any NPSA position directly.    In instances where business needs prevail, for example, in emergency response situations, the Head of the Business Unit (RRs/DRRs in country offices) may select individuals directly and contract them under a short-term NPSA, provided the candidate meets the requirements of the position.    E. Review and assessment of at least 2 candidates (for short-term NPSAs only)   A hiring unit may proceed to a competitive selection via a review and assessment of at least 2 qualified candidates CVs/P11s.    Assessment procedures:   The assessment procedures used to evaluate candidates for a specific position may vary depending on the position requirements.    The Hiring Manager, in consultation with the HR focal point, will decide on the assessment methodologies to be used to best determine the suitability of the candidate for the position, as well as the relative weight to be assigned to each assessment technique. In order to ensure transparency, Hiring Managers are required to account fully for all techniques used and relative weights assigned.    To ensure a fair and equal assessment of all candidates, assessments for the same position must be conducted following the same assessment methods.   A. Interview panel  The Hiring Unit can establish an ad hoc panel made up of at least three UNDP members of personnel, either FTA or PSA Holders habitually at the same level or higher as that of the NPSA position under assessment. The panel will normally be chaired by a FTA holder, however, when this is not possible, the Head of the Business Unit may authorize the chair of the interview panel to be the PSA holder holding the highest level. Due consideration should be given to diversity and gender considerations, as appropriate for the duty station. The panel provides its recommendation to the Head of the Business Unit for a final decision.  Note: Notwithstanding that programme delivery increasingly relies upon building a close partnership with governments, participation of national counterparts or government officials on UNDP interview panels is generally discouraged but may be permissible in the capacity of “observer”.  In considering if a national counterpart or government official will participate in a panel as an observer, Hiring Units must fully consider the principle of independence as articulated in the United Nations Charter, and determine whether or not such participation would compromise the actual, or perceived, independence of UNDP.  B. Technical assessments   It is important to ensure candidates can deliver the technical aspects of the role. The Hiring Unit has several options to confirm this aspect of the candidate’s profile. This includes psychometric and skill-based assessments offered internally or through an external firm; Asynchronous interviews through a provider such as Vid-cruter; A technical phone screen, writing sample or assessment. The Hiring Unit must share a rubric to assist with evaluating the response from the candidate.  C. Panel desk reviews  Candidates can be assessed using full panel desk reviews A full panel desk review, includes in addition to the review of a candidate’s CV, the review of written responses to the competency-based questions. A full panel desk review can be used to assess both regular and short-term NPSAs.    D. Review and assessment of CVs/P11s  An assessment and review of CVs/P11s can be used ONLY to assess short-term NPSAs.      Preparation of the long-list and short-list    Only candidates who fully meet the required qualifications for the position, as specified in the vacancy announcement, may be short-listed for the post. However, candidates who are within six months of the minimum relevant experience requirement may be considered in situations where a business case is made. The business reason must be documented and on record for the file.  To ensure competitiveness, the shortlist must be comprised of at least two candidates. At least one woman should be included on the short-list. If no female candidate is included on the short-list, the Hiring Unit must document the efforts that have been made to identify qualified female candidates including re-advertisement. Hiring units must ensure that every application to a position is afforded due consideration, and that there is an objective reason provided for including, or not including, candidates on long-lists and short-lists.   The Head of the Business Unit  is responsible and accountable for the quality of the long-list and short-list.     Annex 2: Remuneration Scales, Classification Bands, and Setting the Remuneration for NPSAs  The remuneration scale for NPSAs is established for each country individually and promulgated by the Resident Representative of the country office. While it is understood that the scale does not utilize the same comparators as those used for setting the UN staff salary scales, the UN salary scale is used as a reliable reference point in each country.  In countries with programmes that fall formally under the Support Services of UNDP to National Implementation (NIM),  alternative remuneration scales may be promulgated by the Resident Representative of the country office to be used specifically for NPSAs that fall under the NIM. A NIM-specific remuneration scale shall follow the same principle of fixating a reference (percentage) to the UN salary scale as appropriate, and applied across all the NPSA  levels under the NIM project(s) subject to the NIM-specific remuneration scale.  Generally, adjustments to NPSA scales will be prospective in nature, unless the Bureau Director or his/her Deputy approves the  adjustment retroactively. A Resident Representative may request the retroactive application of a scale,  for compelling reasons  specific to their  country, keeping in mind the implications of such a decision across all entities using the modality. The request must be sent via the Regional Business partner.  A new NPSA scale is established in each country, effective the month following the announcement of a new UN salary scale in that country (not the effective date of the UN salary scale). For example, should a UN salary scale be announced in September, taking effect retroactively as of March, the new NPSA scale would only be established with effect from October and applied accordingly.  Temporary special measures may also be extended to NPSAs in countries where such measures have been introduced by the wider UN due to high inflation rates or other emergency needs, subject to the approval of the UNDP Resident Representative.  In exceptional cases, UNDP may conduct its own remuneration survey for purposes of establishing salary scales in respect of NPSAs in cases where a UN local salary scale for staff in the General service and related categories does not exist or where the application of the UN salary survey methodology has resulted in a remuneration scale that is very significantly different from conditions in the local labour market and has demonstrably and negatively impacted UNDP’s ability to recruit and/or retain personnel over an extended period, in particular in very small countries or micro-states served by a multi-country office.  Such cases could be prompted by, but are not limited to, the application of a reference UN staff salary scale that is manifestly out of date, or where, in a specific country or geographical region, the local labour market is extremely limited such as to preclude a standard UN salary survey from being conducted.    The NPSA comprises a number of levels at which NPSA holders can be appointed. The classification of these levels is aligned to the corresponding UNDP grade levels and is set out in the form of broad bands, as shown in the table below. They provide a necessary degree of flexibility for hiring managers to adjust pay according to skills and market circumstances.   The Bands:      The NPSA remuneration scale is set at 76% of each of its corresponding levels on the national UN salary scale established in the country office. The minimum for each band shall equal 76% of step 1 of the lower of the two grades at the corresponding grade in the national UN salary scale. The maximum is 76% of step 8 of the higher of the two grades. For example: NB2 – \tMin. = UN Salary Scale 4 step 1 x 76% \t\t\t\tMax = UN Salary Scale 5 step 8 x 76% \t\t\t\t  NB1 (which extends into 3 grades, the maximum is established as follows): \tMin. = UN Salary Scale 1 step 1 x 76% \t\t\t\tMax = UN Salary Scale 3 step 10 x 76% \t\t\t\t  While the pay of NPSAs may be set at any point between the minimum and the maximum within each band (the range), the classified level of the position would serve as an indicator for the level of remuneration for individual NPSAs. The default pay is always the equivalent of 76% of the net salary of its corresponding UN scale level. Business Unit Heads may also pay above the default if necessary, that is, in instances where there is a need to pay above the default levels, but not exceeding the maximum of the band, due to contingencies of service and up to any amount from within the respective National Band in which the NPSA level falls. Such contingencies of service for paying below or beyond the default shall require the approval of the Head of the Business Unit, but never beyond the band minimum or maximum, and may include reasons such as budget (if lower than the default but within the band), availability of technical expertise in the local market, and based on the special skills the individual brings with him/her to the position and to the organization.   NPSA salary scales are linked to those applied by the UN only with those provisions of the UN remuneration scales and methodology that apply which are relevant for the purposes of the NPSA. The linkage should not be construed as a direct linkage in terms of common status or objectives or purpose between the contracts, nor conferring rights which apply to other categories of personnel to whom the UN Staff Rules apply. The purpose of contracting NPSAs remains consistent with the overall effort to increase national capacity and expertise in the countries of operation and is geared towards a different market target group hence its original sourcing of survey inputs predominantly from the public sector in the past. The NPSA type of work is strongly linked to the project nature and funding of the activities and functions.  The NPSA targets a different market portion (prevailing instead of best prevailing), and focuses on public sector rather than the private sector. Hence the practical linkage to the UN salary scale as a reference point utilizing those specific portions of comparators that are relevant to the purpose of this contract and not all those utilized by UN standard methodology, and that the link is purely a practical one for a process that is already being invested in.  The NPSA stipulates a fixed level of remuneration in local currency and payments are made in local currency, but also follows the currency established by the UN in that country if the remuneration payments in a currency other than the local currency. If the remuneration scale is denominated in a currency other than the local currency and is paid in local currency, the UN prevailing rate of exchange (UNORE) must be applied. For countries where special measures are approved by the UN and applied to the reference UN salary scales (i.e., payment of national staff salaries in hard currency), the special measures will be automatically applied to the NPSA remuneration scale as well.   Regular NPSAs may be eligible to have a portion of their local salaries transferred directly into their UNFCU accounts in United States Dollars through central Payroll at the prevailing rate of exchange (UNORE), only if exceptional approval of the Associate Administrator through the BMS Director’s Office is obtained, first.  The exceptional approval is time-bound, usually for one-year, and would need to be re-submitted to the Associate Administrator for an additional extension of time at expiration.  Eligibility is also dependent upon any limitation placed by UNFCU on the operation of such accounts.  In situations where there is a freeze on the NPSA salary scale, and where the current pay of an individual on NPSA is on a higher pay than a new position for which the NPSA holder has been newly hired on, the salary of the newly hired NPSA holder shall be protected and maintained at his/her previous nominal salary.     Annex 3: Overview of NPSA benefits         Annex 4: Definition of functions of inherent and continuous nature   Definition of functions of Inherent Nature:   Activities of an inherent nature to the UN are those which require the exercise of substantial discretion in applying UN authority and/or in making decisions for the UN. The activities normally fall into two categories: a) the exercise of high-level authority or b) the establishment of procedures and processes related to the oversight of monetary transactions or entitlements. An inherently UN activity involves:    a. \tBinding UNDP to take or not to take some action by contract, public pronouncement or otherwise;   Determining, protecting, and advancing the interests of the United Nations, by diplomatic means or political means or otherwise;   Significantly affecting the safety and security or property of persons;  Exerting ultimate control over the acquisition, use, or disposition of United Nations property (real or personal, tangible or intangible);   Establishing policies or procedures for the collection, control, or disbursement of funds;   Acting as internal control custodian of the organization. The list below contains an example of such functions that must be held by staff, as specified in UNDP’s internal control framework:    2nd Authority - Approving Managers and Global Payroll Administrator  3rd Authority - Disbursing Officer and Disbursing Officer - Payroll  HR Administrator and Position Administrator  Bank Account Signatory  Trust Fund Manager  Bank reconciliation Approver  Safe custodian  Supplemental roles of: Vendor Approvers, Override match exceptions, Fund manager and Retirement of assets   As such, administering or managing a selection process in accordance with the UNDP standard policies and established processes is not considered an “inherent function”. However, deciding what rules to put into the corporate manuals and policies or making exceptions to such policies, in the interests of the UN is an “inherent function”;    Representing the organization, such as negotiating and deciding with governments or external partners, or deciding on which business line to focus, is considered an “inherent function”. When in doubt, BMS/OHR shall consult with BMS/OFM to determine what is considered an inherent function.      Definition of functions of a continuous nature:    The functions are of continuous nature when the position is primarily core funded (>50%), and     The functions performed under the position are not meant to indirectly support a specific, limited in time, kind of initiative/project, such as a specific business development engagement, study visit, consultancy, specific training, etc.   The position covered by the NPSA is not a temporary replacement of a UNDP post where the staff member incumbent is on an extended leave, such as parental leave, special leave, etc.   Annex 5: Performance Evaluation  Short-Term NPSA:   For short-term NPSAs, only section I of the NPSA Annual Performance Review template needs to be completed.   Regular NPSA:   For regular NPSAs, the evaluation must be completed using the online PMD platform. If the platform is not available, the supervisor can use the form below. Please note that the entire evaluation form needs to be completed.   The NPSA Annual Performance review must be completed by the supervisor in line with the regular performance management cycles as set out by the administration and applying the same cycle consistently across all personnel (calendar year). The simplified performance management process is initiated at the start of the year with clearly set goals to achieve as per the work plan of the unit and the individual, as well as learning and development plans of the individual, and agreed on by the supervisor. The performance assessment is conducted within the regular set schedule at the start of the following year and conducted against the set goals. The assessment by the supervisor is completed after:    a short written self-assessment is provided by the NPSA holder including on their special accomplishments; and  a Performance review session with the individual NPSA holder with a view to discuss performance during the reporting period.    The performance assessment must include details regarding performance during the review period, as applicable, any mention of service provided above or below expected standards or in addition to those activities established in the TOR. Should the performance be evaluated as below the acceptable performance levels, a recommendation for non-extension or termination should be clearly stated and reasoned. If the PMD platform is not available, the NPSA Annual Performance Review template should be used for the evaluating regular NPSAs.                Annex 6: To be included in NPSA file, where applicable – Checklist   Check list of documentation for the NPSA holder   Terms of Reference (TOR) Certification of appropriateness of functions for use of an NPSA (included as part of the TOR template) Classification level and report (included as part of the TOR template)  Confirmation of remuneration level (e.g., costing sheet)   Minutes of the Ad-hoc panel with relevant supporting engagement documents   Reference check report   Medical certification from recognized Physician   Copies of professional qualifications in line with NPSA level (if applicable) Completed and signed NPSA face sheet and its General Terms and Conditions  Signed ‘Certificate of No Contest’ – Annex 9 to this policy Application for medical coverage   Application for Death and Disability coverage   Signed acknowledgement that NPSA holder has received all documents and information related to social security and MAIP coverage   Amendments/Extensions to NPSA-with signed acceptance   Copy of passport/ID Bank details authorization for direct deposit of remuneration distribution (or Vendor form) Service Evaluations Minutes of the selection, where applicable   Termination notification, where applicable.      Annex 7: Equipment & Supplies   Any equipment or supplies that may be furnished by UNDP to the NPSA holder for the performance of the NPSA holder’s obligations under the NPSA remains the property of  UNDP,  and  any  such equipment or supplies must be returned to UNDP at the conclusion of the NPSA or before if no longer needed by the NPSA holder. Such equipment, when returned to UNDP, must be in the same condition as when delivered to the NPSA holder, subject to normal wear and tear, and the NPSA holder will be liable to compensate UNDP for any damage or degradation of the equipment that is beyond normal wear and tear.       Annex 8: Transitional Measures (pay scale rollout)  Transitional measures:    From the date of entry into force of this policy on 1 June 2021, all new national, non-staff personnel engaged to provide services which are not lumpsum based will be under the NPSA, and the setting of the remuneration scale for NPSAs will follow the formula introduced by this policy. As a modality that is being introduced to replace the existing Service Contract modality in UNDP, the transition from an existing Service Contract will follow the phased approach described in this Annex 8.   Also, from 1 June 2021, the use of the local Individual Contract (IC) agreement will be limited to lump sum-based activities only. All other activities for which the services of an individual contractor (national) are not based on a lump sum against specific deliverables will be undertaken on the basis of an NPSA. It is therefore envisaged that a number of national ICs who fall under this category will be transitioned to NPSA upon expiry of their existing contracts on or before 31st March 2022, whichever is earlier. For example, should a national IC with activities that are not lumpsum-based have an expiration date of 30 June 2021, an extension should be through a conversion to an NPSA as of 1 July 2021. Current IC agreements which are not lumpsum based may be extended on ICs for periods that may not exceed 31 March 2022.  During the transition period from 1 June 2021 until 31 March 2022, the conversion of local ICs to NPSAs shall not require a new selection process provided that the activities to be carried out are under the same TORs and classified at the same levels. When transitioned, the new remuneration scales of the NPSA shall apply, and the newly introduced benefits for the NPSA, where applicable, will apply as of their respective NPSA effective starting date.   Transitioning of current Service Contract holders to NPSA:  The NPSA is expected to replace the Service Contract modality in UNDP, and with that, all individuals currently contracted under the Service Contract modality and the Individual Contract (local) and who would be continuing their services with UNDP (except those whose local IC agreements are lumpsum-based) are expected to be converted to their corresponding classification level and their corresponding NPSA pay scale upon their extensions anytime between 1 June and 30 June2022 as a one-time transition. Current Service Contracts or local Individual Contract agreements which are not lumpsum based may be extended on their same contractual agreements any time before 1 June 2021 for periods that may not exceed 30 June 2022. As such, no Service Contracts for UNDP personnel will exist beyond 30 June 2022.   The full transition of the Remuneration Scales in relation to any existing Service Contract salary scales to the new NPSA scale, and the transitioning of individuals’ pay levels from their current Service Contract to the NPSA pay scale will be rolled out starting 1st of June 2021 and completed no later than 30 June 2023. While this policy provides a suggested approach to rollout, Resident Representatives will assess and determine the stages of the rollout which are most suitable to their respective office context.   Transitioning of entitlements:  While it is understood that the NPSA is being introduced as a new modality and does not formally replace the Service Contract, UNDP shall permit the crediting of the following entitlements to the new NPSA upon conversion from Service Contract only:  Annual leave balance: Up to 18 days. Parental leave for birth parents leave: Months worked under the Service Contract would count towards the accumulated eligibility for parental leave of 16 weeks.  Transitioning of (national) Individual Contract holders to NPSA:  From the date of entry into force of this policy on 1 June 2021, all new national non-staff hires against tasks which are not lumpsum based will be on NPSA, and the remuneration calculation will follow the formula introduced by this policy.   Individuals whose current remuneration is higher than that of the equivalent levels on the new scale will not be eligible for annual increments until such time where their remuneration matches the 0.76 mark.   All new personnel hired as of 1 June 2021 will have their remuneration set according to the new NPSA scale in place.   Also, from 1 June 2021, the use of the IC agreement will be limited to lump sum-based activities only. All other activities for which the services of a national individual contractor are not based on a lump sum against specific deliverables will be undertaken on the basis of an NPSA. It is therefore envisaged that a number of ICs who fall under this category will be transitioned to NPSA upon expiry of their existing contracts or before 1st January 2022, whichever is earlier. For example, should an IC with activities that are not lumpsum-based have an expiration date of 31 July 2021, an extension to that should be through a conversion to an NPSA as of 1 August 2021. Current IC agreements which are not lumpsum based may be extended on ICs any time before 1st of June 2021 for periods that may not exceed 31 December 2021.  During the transition period throughout 2021, the conversion of ICs to NPSAs shall not require a new selection process if under the same TORs and are classified and paid at similar levels. When transitioned, the new remuneration formula of the NPSA shall apply, and the newly introduced benefits for the NPSA, where applicable, will apply as of their respective NPSA effective starting date.   The following staged approach is being suggested for country offices:  For countries where the current SC salary scales (by grade) against the UN salary scale are (as of 1 March 2021):  Higher than that of the UN salary scales, i.e., resulting in a decrease: In which case, the levels of net pay of existing personnel would be frozen until the future NPSA salary scale catches up with them, or by 30 June 2023, whichever comes first. Any contracts or extensions beyond 30 June 2023 will be set at the applicable NPSA scale.  Lower than the UN salary scales resulting in an increase of:  0-10%  Change of current SC scale is applied effective 1 June 2021 and is applied to all NPSAs at the time of the conversion.  11-20% Change to current SC scale is either applied fully effective 1 June 2021 (to be decided by the Head of the Business Unit), or gradually in two equal stages by applying a mid-point effective 1 June 2021 to fully reach the 0.76 reference point on 1 July 2022   >21% Change to current SC scale is either applied fully effective 1 June 2021 (to be decided by the Head of the Business Unit), or gradually in up to three equal stages effective 1 June 2021, 1 July 2022, to fully reach the 0.76 reference point on 1 July 2023.  For all countries, the scale in its staggered approach applies to current and new hires equally, to avoid paying new hires more than current ones at any time during the rollout.         Annex 9: Certificate of No Contest  Pension Lump Sum   CERTIFICATE OF NO CONTEST  Name:     \tI hereby certify that I accept payment of a monthly lump sum in lieu of pension contributions in accordance with the provisions of the UNDP policy on National Personnel Services Agreement and as specified in my contractual agreement with UNDP.

    "non-reimbursable-loan-agreements": " Non-Reimbursable Loan Policy  1.0\tRegulations and Rules  This policy sets out the conditions for UNDP to accept Non-Reimbursable Loans of persons from Governments, donors or from other sources external to UNDP subject to the application of UNDP Financial Regulation 5.07.   2.0\tPolicy   Introduction  The purpose of this policy is to clarify the provisions relating to receiving personnel under non-reimbursable loan modality. The annex to the present policy contains a model of the memorandum of agreement (MOA) for such loans, which should be drawn up between the government, donor or public entity external to UNDP (Partner Entity (ies)) and the recipient office. The MOA is the legal basis of the arrangement and is to be concluded between the Partner Entity and the recipient office. (LINK to MOA)  The non-reimbursable loan of persons from Partner Entities is permissible, subject to the provisions of Financial Regulation 5.07 and applicable procedures of the Office of Human Resources and this policy.  A non-reimbursable loan is defined as a loan of the services of a person without any cost to UNDP for his or her salary or remuneration, allowances, medical, dental and life insurance or other benefits.    Purposes for which non-reimbursable loans may be negotiated  Non-reimbursable loans may be negotiated between a Partner Entity and UNDP for the provision of services to UNDP required to assist in the execution of activities of a technical nature or for knowledge sharing activities where a best practice has been established.  Where UNDP has not been approached by a Partner Entity and requires assistance of a technical nature and chooses to use the non-reimbursable loan modality, it should present its request collectively to its known Partner Entities.  Such loans may be negotiated in respect of services for any UNDP Office that is in a family duty station, any exception must be approved by the UNDP Security Office.  The use of non-reimbursable loans should be temporary in nature with initial individual loans not exceeding a duration of two years and cumulatively, not exceeding five years.   Under no circumstances shall a non-reimbursable loan be used to engage a person as a staff member, or build professional skills in that person so as to position or enable that person to be later considered for a staff appointment, or a consultant contract. Such loans may not be used to acquire services from private entities, instead a pro-bono agreement must be negotiated to that effect.    UNDP may limit the number of non-reimbursable loans from a Partner Entity at any given time.    Legal status and obligations of persons serving on non-reimbursable loan  Persons whose services are accepted on a non-reimbursable loan are not staff members of UNDP or otherwise employed or contracted by UNDP. The contractual relationship of such persons to UNDP is established by MOA between the entity providing the person, and UNDP.  Their relationship is subject only to the terms of that agreement and not to the United Nations Staff Regulations or Rules. For the purpose of the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, such persons are considered ‘experts on mission’ within the meaning of article VI, sections 22 and 23, of that Convention when performing functions for UNDP. If required by UNDP to travel, they may receive a United Nations travel certificate.  During the performance of their services with UNDP, persons on non-reimbursable loans shall be bound by the Standards of Conduct set out in ST/SGB/2002/9, binding on experts on mission, and any provisions agreed to by the Partner Entity in the MOA. Persons on a non-reimbursable loan shall neither seek nor accept instructions from any Government or any other authority external to UNDP. They shall not engage in any activity that is incompatible with the proper discharge of their terms of reference. They are required to exercise the utmost discretion in all official business and may not communicate to any other person, Government or authority information known to them by reason of their work with UNDP that has not been made public, except in the course of their duties or by explicit authorization of UNDP. Nor shall they at any time use such information to private advantage. These obligations do not cease upon completion of their service.  Persons on non-reimbursable loans shall:  be given access to UNDP premises and systems in accordance with UNDP’s policy; complete all training courses deemed mandatory by UNDP;  neither exercise supervisory functions on UNDP staff members nor commit UNDP financially or otherwise; not be considered for employment by UNDP for a period of six months following the conclusion of the loan.      Title rights  The title rights, copyright rights and all other intellectual and/or ownership rights in any material produced by the person serving on a non-reimbursable loan basis shall be vested exclusively in, and remain with UNDP.   Requisites for acceptance of services on a non-reimbursable basis  The requisites for acceptance of services on a non-reimbursable basis include:  In coordination with the OHR Business Partner, the Bureau or Office concerned  prepares the Terms of Reference (ToRs) listing the duties and functions and duration of the loan. When necessary, the OHR Business partner will assist with the selection strategy based on competition and the need to secure the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity;  A communication from the prospective Partner Entity agreeing:   To provide the services requested under subparagraph (a) above, free of all costs to UNDP;  To the established value of the services to be based on UNDP’s pro-forma costs for functions at a similar level.  In accordance with the principles of full cost recovery on in-kind contributions, to pay eight percent (8%) per cent of the value of the services to the credit of an account specified by OFM;  Certification by the requesting office that the proposal does not directly or indirectly involve additional financial liability for UNDP, except as agreed in the MOA;   Review of the MOA by the Legal Office (LO), if any changes to the MOA template are made;   If applicable, approval of the candidate(s) by the Office of Human Resources in accordance with the established policies and procedures of that Office, the selection strategy agreed to or the specific selection procedure detailed in the MOA between the Partner Entity and the recipient office;  Acceptance of the candidates by any Governments or authorities to which they may be assigned during the period of the non-reimbursable loan, if applicable.  The requisites of paragraph 15 (b) shall be set out in the MOA signed between UNDP and the Partner Entity.   Duration of service and termination of agreements \t Individual non-reimbursable loans are negotiated for a period not to exceed five years. A non-reimbursable loan may be terminated at any date prior to its scheduled expiration at the request of the person serving on loan, the Partner Entity or UNDP giving the notice agreed upon in the MOA.    Evaluation  A written evaluation of services performed by persons on a non-reimbursable loan will be made by the responsible Office and transmitted, on request, to the Partner Entity, with a copy to the Office of Human Resources.

    "organizational-unit-restructuring": " Organizational Unit Restructuring Policy  Purpose  The purpose of this document is to set out UNDP’s human resources policy for carrying out restructures of organizational units, including special placement and selection measures.   Objectives  The operational environment changes very quickly. Organizations should be able to adjust to changes proactively, have the capacity to manage their structures dynamically, and be able to effectively re-distribute skills, competencies, and resources to respond to such changes. Constant adaptation is necessary to improve business performance, retain competitive advantage, and remain relevant to stakeholders’ needs and expectations. This must be done within the spirit of the organizational principles of transparency, fairness, and accountability and in order to enhance UNDP’s capacity to fulfil its development mandate.  To support the achievement of UNDP’s strategic objectives, the organization needs an optimal design for each organizational unit across the entire institution. A range of factors can result in the need to modify the organizational structure by restructuring an organizational unit. Examples of organizational drivers that may result in the need to restructure an organizational unit could include, but are not limited to:  (a)\tChanging programme requirements; (b)\tExpiration of finite mandates (such as country programme cycles or technical assistance projects); (c)\tNew country programme cycles and priorities; (d)\tPost conflict or emergency situations; (e)\tSignificant changes in budget and funding; (f)\tAudit findings or the outcome of investigations.   Main Principles  Restructures of organizational units and the related processes should be managed with care and taking into consideration the development results expected and the associated risks. The approach taken must adhere to the following principles:  Rationale: the objective of the change is well defined and understood by key stakeholders, and activities to achieve the objective are clearly formulated, communicated, and implemented in a transparent manner.  Accountability: the ownership of, and accountability for, change are clearly and unambiguously established. UNDP’s Accountability Framework is adhered to, and any exceptional accountability arrangements are defined, approved and documented.  Risk management: the approach ensures that risks and liabilities to UNDP are identified, mitigated and managed. The organization is enabled to respond to present and future contingencies in an appropriate manner.  Fairness: the policy ensures that staff will be treated equitably, fairly and in a manner that is free of all forms of discrimination.  Wellbeing: this policy acknowledges the value UNDP places on its people and seeks to minimize possible negative impacts of change on staff and their wellbeing.  Engagement: Heads of Unit are required to engage and communicate with staff throughout the change management process.  Efficiency and effectiveness: With due regard to the above-mentioned principles, this policy recognises the need for changes to organizational structures to be implemented in accordance with approved timelines.   Applicability  This Policy applies to all staff members holding a UNDP Letter of Appointment and hired on Fixed-Term Appointments (FTA) and Permanent Appointments (PA), referred to for the purposes of this policy as ‘staff members’.  It also covers UNDP staff members with a lien to a specific position who are on Special Leave Without Pay or on secondment or loan under “The Inter-Organization Agreement concerning the Transfer, Secondment or Loan of Staff among the Organizations applying the UN Common System of Salaries and Allowances”. Such staff members must be informed and their participation arranged in any restructuring process of the organizational unit to which their position belongs which occurs during their absence.    This Policy does not apply to staff members holding UNDP Letters of Appointment for service limited to another UN entity. It also does not apply to staff hired on Temporary Appointments (TA) or personnel working for UNDP under any other contractual modality.  This policy applies to staff members of United Nations Volunteers (UNV) and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) as modified according to those entities’ internal roles, responsibilities, and approving authorities.  Changes to the structure of an organizational unit which affects a limited number of individual functions in a unit of up to 20 percent of overall staff positions, for example abolishing or creating a position or making a substantive change to the main duties and responsibilities of an existing position are considered as an organizational realignment. This will be implemented by the management of the organizational unit concerned consistent with the organisation’s relevant policies related to human resources management. Such cases do not fall within the scope of this policy and an Organizational Unit Restructuring Proposal (OURP) is not a requirement. However, at the discretion of the Head of Unit the elements of the restructuring process set out in this policy can be applied fully or partially to an organizational realignment.   For the purposes of this policy an organizational unit is defined as a bureau, office and unit at headquarters, and outside headquarters as a regional bureau, a country office or an outposted office.   Roles And Responsibilities  The roles and responsibilities for organizational unit restructuring are as follows:  Bureau Director: is accountable for the restructuring process and for ensuring the intended objectives are achieved, costs are kept within the allocated resource limits for the OURP, and the principles outlined in this policy are observed. The Bureau Director is responsible for approving initiation of the restructuring process and taking a final decision on the OURP containing the proposed new structure and ensuring the necessary financial resources are available, where the change affects only part of a Bureau.   Associate Administrator: is responsible for approving initiation of a restructuring process and for taking a final decision on the OURP for organizational units that do not report to a Bureau Director and instead report to the Associate Administrator or Administrator, or in cases in which an entire Bureau will be impacted.   Head of Unit: is responsible for identifying the need for and scope of a change process, and for overall planning and implementation of the restructuring process. The Head of Unit is accountable to the Bureau Director / Associate Administrator for implementation of the OURP and for ensuring effective outreach and communication with staff.  Bureau for Management Services (BMS) / Office of Human Resources (OHR):  is responsible for the provision of advisory services, oversight of the restructuring process, as well as ensuring compliance with this policy. This includes advising consultants or other resources engaged to manage the HR implementation locally. BMS / OHR is responsible for assessing human resources implications and providing clearance for OURPs.  BMS / Office of Finance and Resource Management (OFRM): is responsible for reviewing the financial implications and providing clearance for OURPs.  BMS Director: is responsible for reviewing all the Management Services implications and providing final clearance on behalf of BMS for OURPs. The BMS Director may approve exceptional measures, including waivers or special implementation procedures, if deemed to be in the interests of the organization.  Staff Association / Council: the Staff Association / Council concerned should be regularly informed throughout the restructuring process and staff representatives should support outreach and communication with affected personnel. A representative from the Staff Association / Council will participate as an active observer on the Advisory Panel for Position Confirmation, without voting rights.  Advisory Panel: is responsible for providing recommendations to the Head of Unit on proposals for position confirmation and placement and selection as a result of the Competitive Selection Exercise.  HR Facilitator / Consultant: if applicable, is responsible for supporting and facilitating the restructuring process.    Organizational Unit Restructuring Processes   Restructuring Organizational Units   An organizational unit restructuring process may be initiated by the Administrator. Alternatively, approval to initiate the process to restructure an organizational unit must be sought by the Head of Unit and approved by the responsible Bureau Director where the change affects only part of a bureau, or otherwise the Associate Administrator in cases in which the entire bureau will be impacted, or the change affects a unit which reports to the Associate Administrator or the Administrator.  Where structural changes will involve a significant proportion of the overall staff positions within the unit of more than twenty percent such cases will be managed as a restructure and an OURP is required.   Once the request to initiate an organizational unit restructuring process has been approved, an OURP outlining the recommended new structure must be prepared by the relevant Head of Unit with advice from the responsible BMS / OHR Business Partner.    Preparing an Organizational Unit Restructuring Proposal  The OURP must be prepared using the Template for Organizational Unit Restructuring Proposals and will include:  Location of the unit;  The rationale for restructuring the Unit, an outline of the main outputs that would be delivered by the unit under the new design and an explanation of how the proposed structure better supports the organization’s Strategic Plan, and the country programme if applicable, and how it contributes to efficient and effective use of resources;  An organizational chart including all proposed staff positions, titles, grade levels, position numbers, and funding source for each position. The organizational chart should demonstrate a logical, consistent, and coherent structure based on business needs. Careful consideration must be given to the funding source to be used for each position based on the nature and expected duration of the associated tasks.   An overview of all changes that would occur as a result of the new structure including new positions, positions to be abolished, positions to be reclassified at a new grade level, and information on whether the positions are currently encumbered.  An assessment of the financial sustainability of the organizational structure, including cost implications and how funding will be provided.   The OURP will be signed off by the requesting Head of Unit and endorsed by the responsible Director. For organizational units that do not report to a Director and instead report to the Associate Administrator or Administrator, or in cases in which an entire Bureau will be impacted, the proposal will be signed off by the requesting Head of Unit and endorsed by the Associate Administrator.   Once the OURP is finalized, the Head of Unit or Bureau Director will initiate the clearance process, ensuring other relevant units such as BMS / OHR and BMS / OFM are consulted to assess the proposal’s human resources implications and confirm availability of funding, prior to final clearance by the Director of BMS, followed by final approval by the Bureau Director or Associate Administrator so that implementation can be initiated.    Implementation of organizational unit restructuring  Restructure of organizational unit  After approval has been granted, the required implementation of the organizational unit restructure is managed as a package using the Organization’s applicable processes for position design, position classification, and position reclassification. The implementation process is undertaken in consultation with the relevant BMS / OHR Business Partner.   Implementation should follow the special process for confirmation, placement, and competitive selection outlined in this section. The strategy that will be applied utilising the menu of options available under the special process set out below, will be identified by the Head of Unit at the start of the process.  Organizational unit restructuring processes may not be used to address unsatisfactory staff performance or conduct which must be addressed exclusively through the relevant performance management and / or disciplinary procedures.  The Head of Unit may wish to arrange for the provision of assistance for job search (for example CV preparation, competency-based interview skills training), including but not limited to the Talent Development Unit resources. The nature and degree of support available should be clearly communicated to staff and any related costs borne by the requesting unit. . The Director BMS / OHR retains the right to establish special implementation procedures for confirmation, placement and selection for any specific restructuring of an organizational unit if deemed to be in the interests of the organization. In cases in which the Director BMS / OHR does not support the establishment of special implementation procedures, a Bureau Director may request the BMS Director’s implementation of special implementation procedures due to exceptional circumstances if this can be shown to be in the interests of the organization.    Advisory Panel  The Head of Unit establishes an Advisory Panel composed of a minimum of three people plus the Head of Unit or the Head of Unit may instead designate someone to act as their representative on the Panel. The Advisory Panel members must have the appropriate skills and experience to be able to assess and make proposals on the suitability of the individuals under consideration for position confirmation and placement and selection under the Competitive Selection Exercise (CSE). To enhance impartiality and transparency, in addition to UNDP staff members, Advisory Panel members may include staff from another United Nations organization or non-staff such as consultants contracted to take part in the restructuring process, provided that at least half the Panel is comprised of UNDP staff members. A representative from the Staff Association / Council will participate as an observer on the Advisory Panel for the Position Confirmation stage of the process. Should a staff representative who has been provided with reasonable notice be unable or unwilling to participate within the agreed timeline, the process will proceed.  The Head of Unit may establish one Advisory Panel for the Position Confirmation and Placement Process and a different Panel for the Competitive Selection Exercise or may utilize the same Panel for both processes.    Position Confirmation and Placement Process (PCPP)  The Position Confirmation and Placement Process consists of two main stages:  Stage one - Position Confirmation: The Panel makes a recommendation on staff members that can be confirmed on positions that are considered to be the same since they have not substantively changed.   Stage two – Position Placement: The Panel makes a recommendation on staff members that could be offered a promotion to an upgraded position or who could be offered a lateral reassignment prior to and without competitive selection.   Position Confirmations will be notified to the staff member concerned. Proposed Position Placements will be subject to agreement on the part of the staff member.   Stage one - Position Confirmation  The Advisory Panel determines which positions have or have not substantively changed by comparing the new and previous job descriptions. In general, a job description can be considered to have substantively changed if the category or grade level has changed or there has been a significant change in more than two functions. To be considered significant, changes must occur in the main functions and levels of accountability and responsibility of the position and not in the specific results expected or specific duties / tasks, or one or more new functions from a different technical area have been added or replace the original functions of the position.  In the case of encumbered positions that are considered the same because they have not substantively changed, the Advisory Panel can recommend to the Head of Unit that the incumbent be confirmed in the position.   In cases where multiple staff encumber a generic or substantively similar position, and at least one but not all of those positions will be abolished due to restructuring, confirmation in the position is not possible, and all such positions will be treated as abolished and considered as newly established positions.   Encumbered positions with job descriptions that are determined to have substantively changed or which are reclassified at a different level (upwards or downwards) or in a different category as part of the restructure of an organizational unit must be treated as abolished positions. In such a case, the positions that result from the restructuring will be considered as newly established positions.   In addition to encumbered positions which will not be subject to position confirmation, vacancies arising from the creation of a new position and unencumbered positions will be considered as part of stage two of the PCPP.    Stage two - Position Placement  The Panel will determine which existing encumbered positions were upgraded to a higher level due to additional responsibilities of the same nature and greater complexity. Provided the upgrade is no more than one grade and the position remains in the same category, the staff member encumbering the position can be recommended by the Panel to the Head of Unit for promotion and placement on the higher-level post. In making its recommendation, the Panel will review whether the staff member has sufficient skills and experience to meet the minimum requirements, including but not limited to having been rostered for a position of this type or found suitable for a position of this nature as a result of the Talent Review process. The staff member will also need to have demonstrated satisfactory performance in their most recent performance appraisal. In such cases, the staff member will retain their lower-level personal grade for a qualifying period of six to twelve months before being converted to the higher grade retroactively back to the start date of the placement.  In the interests of placing as many staff members as possible and to facilitate the objectives of the Mobility Policy, the Panel may make recommendations to the Head of Unit on potential lateral reassignments of any staff member (including those who have been confirmed in their position) to any other suitable positions within the unit for which the staff member is considered by the Panel to have the required skills and experience (including positions which involve relocation to another duty station). In the event that a staff member does not wish to accept a position to which they have been offered a placement, the position may be offered to another suitable staff member or it will be open to Expressions of Interest under the CSE.   Competitive Selection Exercise (CSE)  In order to minimize the impact on staff in the organizational unit which is being restructured, following conclusion of the PCPP, a CSE will be conducted for all positions which still remain available. These positions will be open to Expressions of Interest from all staff members in the affected unit. Positions communicated to staff as part of the CSE will remain open for a minimum of five working days. Staff members who have already been confirmed or placed in a position under the PCPP are still eligible to apply and be considered for a maximum of three vacancies as part of the CSE. However, for International Professionals the minimum duration of assignment requirement contained in the Mobility Policy will normally apply. For staff who have not been confirmed or placed in a position under the PCPP, there is no cap on the number of vacancies they can apply for and for International Professionals the minimum duration of assignment requirement will be waived.  A staff member would normally be expected to seek appointment to a position at the same grade level or higher. However, if the staff member is encumbering a position that is being abolished due to the restructure, they may apply for a position no more than one grade lower than their personal grade. If appointed to the position, the staff member may retain their personal grade for two years on the understanding that reasonable efforts will be made by the staff member and the organization to facilitate appointment to a position at the same personal grade. At the conclusion of the two-year period, if the staff member is still serving in the lower-graded position, the personal grade will be adjusted, and the staff member will be put at the lower grade level of the position.  For the CSE, there will be no requirement for a minimum number of candidates overall or from each gender for each vacancy.  The CSE will utilise an assessment process applying one or more appropriate assessment tools (for example desk review, competency-based interview, testing) which must include at least a desk review to evaluate all internal candidates who are shortlisted by the Advisory Panel for each vacancy. If written tests are applied these are to be scored anonymously by at least two suitably skilled individuals. All assessment tools that will be used and the respective weighting that will be applied must be decided and documented in advance of commencement of the assessment process.   The Head of Unit may add additional members to the Advisory Panel on an ad-hoc basis for any particular vacancy, or involve other individuals in other aspects of the assessment process as appropriate, for example to prepare and assess technical tests, if it is considered that this expertise is required to accurately assess the suitability of candidates.   If at least one internal candidate is found suitable for a position, the suitable candidate(s) will be recommended for selection in ranked order by the Advisory Panel, subject to satisfactory performance in the most recent performance appraisal, and with regard to the priority for retention established by the Termination of Appointment Policy.   In the event that there is only one shortlisted candidate for a position as part of the CSE, and this individual has previously either been rostered for a position of this type or else found suitable for a position of this nature as a result of the Talent Review process, the candidate can be recommended for appointment to the position by the Advisory Panel without the need to go through a further assessment process.  Following this, if there are any positions which still remain available, the Advisory panel may recommend placement of an unassigned staff member in a position provided they did not previously apply to the position as part of the CSE and were found unsuitable. The position must be at the same grade level or one grade level below the staff member’s personal grade and based on a review by the Panel the staff member has sufficient skills and experience to meet the minimum requirements of the position. The consent of the staff member to such placement will be required. In the case of placement in a lower graded position a staff member can maintain their personal grade and step for two years.   Before final decisions on competitive placement via the CSE are taken by the competent authority, recommendations will be subject to a compliance review body process as applicable.   Remaining Vacancies  Any remaining positions for which no suitable internal candidate is identified following the CSE will be filled in accordance with the applicable selection procedures in UNDP’s Recruitment Policy. In the first instance this will be as part of a normal internal selection process which is open to internal applications from staff UNDP-wide and not only the affected unit.   Any positions which remain unfilled by internal candidates as a result of the normal internal selection process will then be advertised externally and subject to a normal external selection process open to any internal and external candidates. Any internal candidate who already applied to the vacancy as part of the normal internal selection process and was not selected will be excluded from consideration as part of the external selection process. The assessment for the external selection process would require at a minimum for candidates to participate in a competency-based interview.    Unassigned staff  The order of retention of staff contained in UNDP’s Termination of Appointment Policy will be applied. A staff member who is left unassigned at the end of the restructuring process will be subject to the terms of, and protections contained in, the relevant parts of the policy for staff whose position is terminated for reasons of abolition of position or reduction of staff.

    "overtime-compensation": "Overtime Compensation    Overtime means the time worked in excess of the scheduled workday or scheduled workweek or during any of the UN official holidays.    The following is not considered as overtime:     Time spent travelling to and from the place of work    Work performed during the lunch period    Work performed outside regular working hours due to the adoption of a shift system except when the total time worked exceeds the scheduled workday or workweek    In accordance with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) practices, all staff members, except those working on a part-time basis, must take a minimum 30-minute lunch break during the regular work-day.     Supervisors are expected to arrange the work of their organizational units so that overtime is an exceptional occurrence.     In the interests of health, safety and efficiency of the staff:     Overtime for all staff, including drivers, should normally be limited to 40 hours per month, unless there are very exceptional circumstances    Overtime for all staff, including drivers, should not be performed for periods longer than six hours without an unpaid break of at least 30 minutes    Staff members should take one complete day of rest in each calendar week, unless there are very exceptional circumstances    Staff members whose pregnancy has been confirmed are exempted, on request, from working overtime    Overtime compensation (OC) is payable to General Service (GS) staff members, with Permanent, Continuing or Fixed-Term appointments governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.    OC is neither payable to National Professional Officers (NPOs) nor to International Professional staff members.    Conditions and Rate for Staff Members Working on a Scheduled Workday    8.  This also applies to official holidays that are not official UN holidays. The following conditions apply for:     New York Headquarters locations (also applies to Copenhagen and Geneva):     Work in excess of the scheduled workday but less than eight hours, is entitled to an equal period of compensatory time off (CTO), but not to additional cash payment. Subject to the exigencies of the service, such CTO may be given at any time during the four months following the month in which the work was done.    Work in excess of eight hours a day may be compensated either by CTO or additional cash payment, at the staff member's choice, at one and a half times the normal rate.     If, at the time of a review to be conducted three times a year, it is ascertained that a staff member has accumulated more than 40 hours of CTO that could not be authorized because of the exigencies of the service or sick leave (SL), compensation takes the form of additional cash payment in respect of each hour in excess of 40 hours. The remaining entitlement to 40 hours of CTO will be counted as part of the staff member’s accumulated entitlement at the time of the next review.     Field locations:     Work in excess of the scheduled workday but less than eight hours, or in excess of the workweek schedule but less than 40 hours, is entitled to an equal period of CTO, but not to additional cash payment. In those duty stations where longer than 40-hour workweeks have been established for certain categories of staff (drivers, messengers, and other custodial staff), overtime does not commence until these hours have been worked.    Work in excess of eight hours a day and 40 hours a week is compensated either by CTO, or additional cash payment, at the staff member's choice, at one and a half the normal rate.    Subject to the exigencies of the service, CTO should take place during the four months following the month in which the work is done; otherwise, it is forfeited. However, if it is ascertained that a staff member could not be authorized CTO because of exigencies of the service or SL, compensation takes the form of additional cash payment.     Conditions and Rate for Staff Members Working on a Non-workday    When a staff member is required to be on duty on a day other than a regularly scheduled workday, or on any of the 10 official holidays, all hours worked on these days are treated as overtime, irrespective of the number of hours worked during the scheduled workweek.     Furthermore, a staff member called upon to work on a non-workday will receive a minimum of four hours of OC, as per the following rates, even if he/she has worked less than four hours:     New York Headquarters locations (also applies to Copenhagen and Geneva):  Saturday, at one and a half times normal rate ii) Sunday, at twice the normal rate   iii) Official UN holiday, at twice the normal rate    Field locations:  Sixth day, at one and a half times normal rate ii) Seventh day, at one and a half times normal rate iii) Official UN holiday, one and a half times normal rate.    The rate for field locations may be modified in areas where it is inconsistent with local practice. Such modifications are normally considered in conjunction with a salary survey, following a recommendation by the Local Salary Survey Committee (LSSC) and review by Headquarters.     Conditions and Rate for Staff Members Away from their Duty Stations on Official Travel    When a staff member is required to travel on official business, the working schedule should normally be organized in such a way as to avoid the need for overtime work while on mission.     Nevertheless, situations may arise where it is necessary to authorize overtime work while the staff member is on travel, e.g., during a holiday. In those situations, overtime may be compensated concurrently with DSA payments.     Time spent travelling to and from a mission area will not be counted as overtime. Only drivers and watchmen may exceptionally accrue overtime while performing their functions (e.g., driving, servicing, or accompanying a vehicle for servicing).       Conditions and Rate, Other     Staff members participating in a workshop or training event are not entitled to overtime. However, staff members providing administrative support to the training event are entitled to overtime.     Part-time GS staff who are required to work in excess of their regular schedule are remunerated at the straight time rate for additional hours worked up to the normal scheduled workday of full-time staff. Thereafter, and for work required on the sixth or seventh day of the scheduled workweek or on an official holiday, they are compensated according to the conditions governing compensation for overtime work applicable to the duty station.     Advance authorization     17. All overtime work must be authorized in advance and the availability of funds must be certified.     Calculation    Compensation for overtime is calculated to the nearest half-hour; casual overtime of less than one half-hour on any day during the scheduled workweek is disregarded.     Payment to staff for overtime worked is based on the staff member’s total net salary plus, if applicable, language allowance. Overtime payments are subject to staff assessment.     OC is not taken into account in determining the following, where applicable:     Pensionable remuneration, contributions to and benefits payable by the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), e.g., retirement benefit, surviving dependant’s benefits   Compensation for service-incurred illness, injury, or death  Special post allowance (SPA)  Medical and life insurance premiums  Separation payments, e.g. commutation of AL, death benefit, termination indemnity, etc.  Grade and step on promotion from the GS to the Professional category    Please note that overtime is not pensionable.     Formula    22. In calculating cash payment for overtime worked, the following formula should be used:     Hours per year = normal hours per week x 52.2 weeks per year   Hourly wage = annual total net salary plus, if applicable, language allowance, hours per year (a)  Overtime rate = hourly wage x the applicable rate (see paragraphs 9 to 12)  OC = overtime hours x overtime rate (c)    Payment     23. Overtime is paid through payroll. The system will calculate the amount to be paid (and the staff assessment deduction).     Currency    24. Overtime is payable in the currency of the duty station (with the exceptions noted, where the salary is paid in another currency).    Overtime Records     25. Each office is responsible for the maintenance of accurate and current records of overtime worked and compensatory leave taken by staff. ",
    "parental-leave": "Parental Leave   Purpose  The purpose of this parental leave policy is to establish parental leave in order to ensure that staff members who become a parent of a child while in UNDP’s service have sufficient time to spend with their families, bond with their child, and fulfil their parental responsibilities, as well as to foster gender parity and equal career development.    Applicability And Effective Date  This parental leave policy applies to all UNDP staff members holding a temporary, fixed-term, or permanent appointment who become a parent to a child while in service with UNDP. This parental leave policy supersedes UNDP’s policies on maternity, paternity and adoption leave for the administration of parental leave in respect of a child born or adopted on or after 1 January 2023 provided that the staff member was in service at the time of the birth or adoption. For a staff member with a child born or adopted on 31 December 2022 or earlier, UNDP’s policies on maternity, paternity, and adoption leave will continue to apply until completion of the respective leave entitlement contained in those policies.   Terms And Conditions of Parental Leave  Conditions applicable to birth parents  Birth parents will be granted a period of paid parental leave of 26 weeks. This consists of a two-week period of leave for pre-natal protection of the birth parent prior to the anticipated delivery date, an eight-week period of post-natal protection, and an additional 16-week period of parental leave for the purposes of parental bonding.   Staff members will commence pre-natal parental leave two weeks prior to the anticipated date of birth, which shall count towards the total period of paid parental leave.   Staff members may request to commence the pre-natal period of parental leave up to six weeks prior to the anticipated date of birth in which case the absence from work will be charged to the total period of 26 weeks of paid parental leave.   Staff members may request to work part-time at 50 percent for up to four weeks prior to the two-week pre-natal period, in which case the absence from work will be charged to the total period of paid parental leave.   If the staff member’s functions allow it, the staff member may request to work remotely up to four weeks prior to the two-week pre-natal period.  For birth parents, parental leave shall be used for any pregnancy-related medical conditions requiring leave within six weeks of the anticipated date of birth (in which case the absence from work will be charged to the total period of paid parental leave).  On the basis of the birth certificate, parental leave will be equivalent to the difference between 26 weeks and the period of pre-natal leave.   The first eight weeks of the post-natal period must be taken continuously beginning on the date of birth of the child. Thereafter the remaining period of parental leave may be taken within 12 months following the child’s date of birth, either continuously or in four separate periods of equal or of different duration of at least one week at a time up to the maximum entitlement of 26 weeks.   If a staff member is unable to return to duty because of ill health after fully exhausting the parental leave entitlement, the staff member may claim their unused uncertified sick leave entitlement or present a medical certificate, so the absence is chargeable to certified sick leave.  In the interest of duty of care and health and safety, for staff members serving in the field in non-family duty stations or those serving in category D and E duty stations that have an absence of adequate medical facilities which require the birth parent to travel by flight outside the duty station to give birth, the staff member should be permitted to leave the duty station six weeks prior to the commencement of the two-week pre-natal period. This six-week period will not be deducted from the parental leave period. Staff members should be requested to telecommute during this six-week period, or if the staff member’s functions do not enable telecommuting, then the relevant period will be chargeable to special leave with full pay (SLWFP).  In the unfortunate event that the child dies shortly before the anticipated delivery date, or during or shortly after birth, the birth parent is entitled to take a continuous period of parental leave of up to 16 weeks.    Conditions applicable to non-birth parents  All parents who are not birth parents are considered non-birth parents for the purposes of this policy.  A paid parental leave of 16 weeks will be granted to non-birth parents for the purposes of parental bonding, provided that the child is recognized as a dependent child of the staff member, or the spouse of the staff member, by UNDP or another UN common system organization. In the case of adoption, the child must be under the age of 18 years at the time of adoption for the staff member to be eligible.   Non-birth parents may take parental leave within 12 months following the child’s birth date or adoption either continuously or in four separate periods of equal or of different duration of at least one week at a time up to the maximum entitlement of 16 weeks.  The 16 weeks of parental leave entitlement of a non-birth parent may be used only once during each twelve-month period.    Conditions applicable to all parents  Where both parents are UNDP staff members, they will each get to utilize their own entitlement to parental leave.  The period of paid parental leave is not increased if the parent gives birth to more than one child, or if more than one child is adopted at the same time.   Sick leave is not granted to a staff member on paid parental leave. Parental leave is based on calendar weeks so any official holidays falling within periods of parental leave will not be deducted from the overall parental leave entitlement.  A staff member accrues service credit for all entitlements during parental leave, except when a termination of appointment is temporarily suspended or an appointment is extended, solely for the purpose of enabling a staff member to utilize their parental leave entitlement.  If a decision is made to terminate a staff member’s fixed-term or permanent appointment, or not to offer an extension of a staff member’s fixed-term appointment, and the staff member is on paid parental leave or is eligible to commence paid parental leave on or before the date of separation, the separation from service will be temporarily suspended for the full duration of the paid parental leave entitlement, to be utilized in one period and on a full-time basis. The period of the parental leave entitlement will be 26 weeks for birth parents and 16 weeks for non-birth parents, or the remaining period until the completion of 12 months following the child’s date of birth or adoption, whichever is shorter. This entitlement does not apply when the staff member is dismissed or separated for misconduct, for abandonment of post, for facts anterior to appointment, or when the staff member reaches the mandatory age of separation.  When a fixed-term appointment is extended solely to enable a staff member to utilize the paid parental leave entitlement, this extension shall not give rise to any further entitlement to salary increment, annual leave, sick leave or home leave, but credit towards repatriation grant may continue to accrue if the staff member has not returned to the recognized home country. In the event of the staff member’s death during the period of the extension, the period prior to the staff member’s death shall be taken into account in the determination of the death benefit.   If a decision is made to terminate a staff member’s temporary appointment, or not to offer an extension of the temporary appointment, and the staff member will be eligible to commence paid parental leave on or before the date of separation, the staff member will be paid a lump sum equivalent to the salary and entitlements for the balance of the period of the unused portion of the entitlement.  Special leave without pay (SLWOP) may be granted as unpaid parental leave to an eligible staff member on a fixed-term or permanent appointment, who is the parent of a newly born or adopted child. In such cases the staff member will not be required to exhaust accrued annual leave before commencement of the SLWOP. Staff members on temporary appointments are not eligible to unpaid parental leave.   Request Procedure  Staff members shall submit requests for parental leave in UNDP’s employee self-service platform as soon as possible to be processed by UNDP’s Global Shared Services Centre (GSSC) in anticipation of the birth or adoption of a child, together with the required supporting documentation.   If the request is submitted after the birth or adoption of the child, it must be accompanied by a birth certificate or an adoption decree. If it is submitted prior to the birth or adoption of the child, it must be accompanied by a certificate from a licensed medical practitioner or midwife indicating the expected date of delivery, or evidence that adoption proceedings have started, and it must subsequently be supplemented by a birth certificate or an adoption decree.   In cases of customary or de facto adoption, the staff member is required to submit a statement from the appropriate national authorities that legal adoption is not possible because there is no statutory provision for adoption or prescribed court procedure for official recognition of customary or de facto adoption. Additionally, the staff member will be required to certify by affidavit or other appropriate formal statement that the child will be residing with the staff member, and that the staff member will assume the duties and obligations of the child’s parent. Once the child has arrived in the staff member’s home, the staff member shall also submit satisfactory evidence that the child resides with the staff member and that a parental relationship has been established.  In the case of birth parents who are required to leave their field duty station by a flight prior to the pre-delivery period and who are claiming SLWFP instead of telecommuting, they will need to request SLWFP in accordance with UNDP’s policy on Special Leave and provide proof of travel out of the duty station such as boarding passes.   Requests for SLWOP as unpaid parental leave will need to be requested in accordance with UNDP’s policy on Special Leave.  Any staff member who will be utilizing Flexible Working Arrangements such as part-time work, teleworking, and telecommuting, will need to submit a request in accordance with UNDP’s policy on FWAs.

    "partner-personnel-services-agreement": "                        1. Purpose and Introduction  Purpose  This policy sets out the nature and purpose of the Partner Personnel Services Agreement (PPSA), as well as the respective roles and responsibilities of the parties, when UNDP engages non-staff personnel through the Personnel Service Agreement, as a service to its client UN entities.    Introduction  PPSA is a contractual modality through which UNDP may engage and administer non-staff personnel contacts for an on behalf of client UN entities - ‘the Partner’ for the purposes of this policy.    By way of background, UNDP may engage personnel under the following scenarios:   For its own needs;  As a service to an eligible entity further to the Financial Regulations and Rules, i.e., either to a UN entity as agency services, or to the implementing partner of a UNDP project, to enable the entity to carry out its development needs or the needs of the project, respectively. If the contract for a UN entity is issued in UNDP’s name, and in the case of contracts issued for implementing partners, UNDP is accountable and responsible under the contract with the individual engaged, and the individual is supervised by and ultimately responsible to UNDP; OR  Where UNDP engages personnel as a service to a Partner and the contract is issued by UNDP on behalf of the named UN Partner, the personnel concerned are considered the personnel of the Partner (“Partner Personnel”). The Partner Personnel and their work are under the full and direct responsibility, supervision and control of the Partner. UNDP shall provide the Partner with an administrative service as described below.   In the case of 1.B.b.iii the personnel are considered the personnel of the Partner (“Partner Personnel”) and are covered by this policy.  In the case of Partner Personnel, UNDP may act solely as a contracting agent through facilitating the engagement of individual(s) for the Partner. The PPSA shall specify the name of the Partner and the nature of the relationship between the Partner and the Partner Personnel engaged thereunder.  2. Criteria for Partner Personnel  For personnel to be considered Partner Personnel under this Policy, all four of the criteria specified (1), (2), (3), and (4) below must be met:   The Partner must be a UN entity.   The PPSA entered into by UNDP with the personnel on behalf of the Partner must contain a provision stating that UNDP is acting as an agent of the Partner, that the contract is issued on behalf of the Partner, and that all contractual rights and responsibilities are with the Partner.   An agreement between UNDP and the Partner must exist in the form of an SLA or any other format as directed by UNDP, (the “Partner Agreement”), in order for UNDP to issue PPSAs for the Partner.  The SLA or such other agreement as corporately required by UNDP, will contain, among other things, provisions stating that: UNDP is acting solely as an agent of the Partner and, except on matters related to the administration of the contract as per the responsibilities outlined in the annex for UNDP,  UNDP neither retains nor accepts any with no liability for contractual actions or claims raised by the Partner Personnel; the Partner will assume all responsibility for investigating any allegations of wrongdoing raised by Partner Personnel, including protection of the Partner Personnel against retaliation for having raised such allegations of wrongdoing; Partner will also indemnify and hold harmless UNDP in the case of any suit, claim or demand against UNDP brought by the individual(s) contracted by UNDP under PSA for the Partner; notwithstanding such assumption of responsibility and indemnification/hold harmless, the Partner must agree to cooperate with UNDP as requested in respect of any claim or demand, including ethics related issues, raised by the individual(s) so contracted by UNDP on the Partner’s behalf.”  Thereafter, specific requests for the issuance of a PPSA will be made by a Request for PPSA from the Partner’s authorized representative, to the UNDP business unit that will be issuing the PPSA, further to Annex 2.  The Partner Personnel concerned may not hold a UNDP Delegation of Authority.    3. Administration   Selection of Candidates  UNDP may issue a PPSA to an individual at the request of a Partner following either of the following selection processes:    Pre-selection bv the Partner  Pre-selection is a common method for contracting candidates to deliver services under a specific TOR and identifying the best available candidate. In this case, the Partner selects the candidate following its own internal processes and requests UNDP to issue the PPSA.   The Partner must provide confirmation that the selection conforms with the Partner’s corporate procedures in the form of a ‘Pre-selection Letter’ (see annex 3 to this policy).  UNDP-supported Selections  UNDP may provide various forms of administrative support to Partners in the selection process.  This is considered “Additional Services” as defined below.   The Partner must provide confirmation of acceptance of the selection outcome (see annex 4 to this policy).  The following summarizes the processes described in (a) and (b) above, and the options under (b):     Internal Administration  UNDP’s role with respect to PPSAs is limited to processing and issuing the contract and processing the payments of fees and other benefits and entitlements set out in the PPSA, further to the Partner Agreement.  The Partner is responsible for internal administration issues and personnel management, such as fee/level setting, travel arrangements, leave administration and performance management.  However, at the Partner’s request and agreement on the cost recovery fee to be charged as set forth in the Partner Agreement or otherwise as agreed on in writing, UNDP may provide administrative and logistical support to the Partner in relation to these services and other functions for which the Partner is responsible, (“Additional Services”).  No Access to UNDP systems  Partner Personnel may not have access to UNDP systems such as UNDP email, UNDP Intranet, UNDP ERP system and UNDP ID cards, unless this is specifically provided for in the Partner Agreement.   Security  The Partner is responsible for reporting the Partner Personnel as its own personnel to bodies such as UNDSS, at both headquarters and the country level, and to UNCT and other bodies that rely on UN agency personnel counts.   Medical Evacuation  The Partner is responsible for ensuring medical evacuations of the Partner Personnel in case of need. The Partner may request, as an additional service (see paragraph G below), logistical support from UNDP in arranging the medical evacuation.  Disputes, Investigations, Financial disclosure and Declaration of interest, Protection against Retaliation, etc  The Partner is responsible for managing disputes, financial disclosure and declarations of interest, investigations, Protection against Retaliation and actions taken further to an investigation in accordance with the terms of the contract in respect of the Partner Personnel. UNDP will be indemnified and held harmless against any claims brought against it by Partner Personnel.  Before a Partner Agreement is signed with any of the foregoing being provided as a possible Additional Service (see point G, below), the Business Unit signing such Partner Agreement must consult with the UNDP substantive unit responsible for the foregoing services (Ethics Office, for protection against retaliation claims; OAI for investigations; LO for any contractual actions to be taken following an investigation conducted by OAI) to ensure such unit’s(s’) agreement to offering such services.  Other Additional Services  At the request of the Partner, UNDP may provide some or all of the administrative services with respect to the items set out in sub-paragraphs 3.C, 3.D, and 3.E and 3.F (except with respect to any claim of dispute brought directly against the Partner, including, but not limited to, a claim by the Partner Personnel seeking protection against retaliation), above, as well as with respect to support in the selection process, and other ad hoc services as may be agreed between UNDP and the Partner with respect to the PPSA issued by UNDP. In this regard, UNDP may provide facilitative, administrative and logistical support to the Partner in relation to these functions for which the Partner is responsible, (“Additional Services”).  In such cases, the Partner’s agreement on the cost recovery fee, consistent with UNDP’s cost recovery business model, and to be charged as set forth in the Partner Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing, must be obtained before the such Additional Services are provided.   The PPSA allows Partners to set the adequate functional levels, pay levels and amounts, as well as the benefits packages of Partner Personnel.  The Partner must make any such requests through its authorized representative, who must hold adequate levels of authority to assume the responsibility and any possible associated risks with the levels of pay and benefits package.  Such standards may be set at the corporate levels applicable to all personnel administered on behalf of the Partner, if a global agreement exists between the Partner and UNDP, or at the country/project level if no global agreement exists or if the global agreement does not limit such requests to be carried at the country/project level.  At the Partner’s request, UNDP may assist it in advising on appropriate levels of pay, as well as determining benefit packages to be applied to Partner Personnel. However, responsibility for determination of salary and benefits rests with the Partner. Prior to concluding any agreement, UNDP will draw the attention to partners on the minimum standards of duty of care, pay levels and minimum coverage expected towards the partner personnel. UNDP may also extend to the Partner the standards of benefits and entitlements, as well as remuneration packages applied by UNDP as a reference to be applied. However, the responsibility on the final standards to be applied rests with the partner and not with UNDP.   UNDP will, as part of its services in the context of this policy, make available a menu of benefits negotiated by UNDP with service providers which Partners can access.    4. Relationship between Partner Personnel and UNDP Pricing Policy   With regards to UNDP pricing, Partner Personnel are not considered UNDP personnel and thus the applicable cost for “Non-Personnel” should be charged.   The issuance and administration of PPSAs must be consistent with the UNDP cost recovery business model (see paragraph 6 below).   5. Authority to enter into Partner Agreement and authority to issue contracts to Partner Personnel within UNDP  A Partner Agreement may be signed by the Head of a Business Unit within UNDP without the prior written approval of the BMS Director, provided that all conditions set out in this policy, and the standard templates issued further to this Policy, are fully complied with.  PPSAs may only be issued and administered by the GSSU. Exceptions to that may only be approved by the BMS Director or his/her delegate.     6. Fees and Pricing  UNDP will apply the following pricing for PPSA administration, for the basic services stated under the responsibility of UNDP in the table of roles and responsibilities (Annex 3). Any Additional Services shall be costed and priced in addition.  Cost of functions directly supporting the administration are comprised of the following, per 400 PSAs:  100% of an ICSC 5 Assistant \t‘A’ 50% of an ICSC 7 Associate\t‘B’ 10% of an ICSC 10 Officer (P3)\t‘C’ 5% of an ICSC 12 Chief (P5)\t‘D’ Sub-Total 1\t\t\t‘E’ 25% GOE on E\t\t\t‘F’ Sub-Total 2\t\t\t‘G’ GMS 8% of G\t\t\t‘H’ RF 5% of G\t\t\t\t‘I’ Total Direct Staff Costs\t\t‘J’ Cost of payroll\t\t\t‘K’ Total Direct Costs\t\t‘L’   Indirect cost to cover the corporate backbone support applies to the total delivery of the project (net of hardship pay and net of costs under ‘a’; but includes remuneration, additional services and coverages requested by the partner, medical insurances, death and disability, Malicious Act Insurance Policy (MAIP) and any other additional benefits paid by UNDP on behalf of the partner:  GMS at 4%\t(net of ‘L’)\t\t‘M’ \t(>1,200 global contracts  for the specific partner) GMS at 5% (net of ‘L’)\t\t‘M’\t(<1,200)  Total applicable Cost =\t\tL + M   UNDP may also wish to apply a standard cost recovery percentage instead of a dollar figure not below the total applicable price derived from the above, for simplicity vis-à-vis the partner proposal, and for internal distribution accordingly, should the partner request that.   7. Transitional Measures  UNDP will inform Partners of the date of entry into force of this policy. Any SLA or other service agreement with Partners for the provision of non-staff personnel contracts, must be replaced with the Partner Agreement for the provision of PPSAs no later than 31 December 2022. No new SC or IC contracts that would otherwise fall under the PPSA policy, may be issued for Partners after that date.                                              Annex 1 – Matrix of Roles and Responsibilities  Respective Roles and Responsibilities of the Parties with Descriptions of Services   1.\tObjective  UNDP Services shall include the activities listed in the below Matrix of Respective Roles and Responsibilities of the Parties.  2.\tManagement Arrangement  When requesting UNDP’s services the requesting PARTNER unit shall provide the following documents to UNDP:  -  Request for Services to UNDP  -  Budget for the expected all duration of the PPSAs requested to be issued -  CV or Personal History Form (P.11) for the individuals to be issued a PPSA  PARTNER is responsible for monitoring the effective use of the PPSA(s) in compliance with relevant rules, regulations and agreements.  UNDP will make available to PARTNER job data information on PPSAs working for PARTNER in electronic formats as agreed between both parties.    3. \tMatrix of Respective Roles and Responsibilities of the Parties with List of Services                                Annex 2 – Request for Services  REQUEST FOR SERVICES  Request No:                                                                    Date:                                            RE: \tPARTNER-UNDP HR SUPPORT SERVICES AGREEMENT  Dear [insert name of the responsible UNDP official], PARTNER hereby submits this Request for Services (hereinafter referred to as “Request”) pursuant to the PARTNER-UNDP HR Support Services Agreement of [insert date] (hereinafter referred to as the \"Agreement\") between PARTNER and UNDP, the provisions of which shall apply to this Request.

    "pension-fund": "Pension Fund          The United Nations Joint Pension Fund (UNJPF) provides participating staff members with benefits in the event of death, disability, separation from service before retirement age, or upon retirement.         This replaces the former equivalent section of the two UNDP Personnel Manuals.        The United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF) (www.unjspf.org) was established by the General Assembly (GA) to provide retirement, death, disability, and related benefits for the staff of the United Nations and other organizations admitted to membership in the Fund.         The Fund is administered by the UNJSPF Board together with staff pension committees from each member organization, with a secretariat to the Board and to each such committee (in tripartite and equal representation).         The assets of the Fund are property of the Fund and are acquired, deposited, and held in the name of the UN on behalf of the participants and beneficiaries of the Fund; however, the assets are held separately from those of the UN and can be used only for the purposes stated in the Fund's Regulations.        Participants         All full-time staff members and staff members who work for at least half the time of a fulltime staff member become participants in the Pension Fund, subject to the following conditions:         If the initial appointment is for at least six months        If, while serving under an appointment which was for less than six months, he/she receives an appointment for at least six months; or         If he/she completes (in the same or more than one member organization) six months of service on a series of shorter appointments, provided there was no break in service of more than 30 days between successive appointments        If the employment is part-time, the entitlement to and the amount of benefits resulting from such employment shall be reduced in the ratio that it bears to full employment.         To qualify for disability and survivor(s) benefits from the Pension Fund, the staff member must undergo a medical examination prior to or as early as practicable after becoming a participant in the Fund.         In exceptional cases, participation in the Pension Fund may be expressly excluded by the terms of an appointment.         Contributions and Benefits         Please consult the Pension Fund website http://www.unjspf.org.         Validation of Special Leave without Pay (SLWOP)        11. Periods of leave without pay (with the exception of leave to perform military service) can be counted as contributory service, provided that the participant assumes responsibility for payment of his/her own contribution and the contribution of the Organization. The contributions due must be paid concurrently in monthly instalments to the same payroll office while the staff member is actually on leave without pay and should be reported to the Pension Fund in the same manner as regular contributions. The local HR/Operations Manager should inform the staff member of this requirement prior to that staff member’s departure.         Validation of Prior Non-Contributory Service        12. Participants may validate (i.e., make contributory) a prior period of non-contributory service, subject to the following conditions:         Validation must be elected within one year of first becoming a participant        There must not have been a break of more than two years between the end of the last period of service and the date on which participation in the Pension    Fund commenced        The entire period of service open to validation must be validated; and         Contributions for the period to be validated must be paid by the participant and UNDP, with compound interest        Restoration of Prior Contributory Service        Participants may restore a previous period of contributory service, subject to the following conditions:         The restoration must be elected within one year after rejoining the Fund as a participant        The previous period of contributory service must have been less than five years (previous contributory service of more than five years may not be restored)         The entire period of service open to restoration must be restored; and         The participant must pay back to the Pension Fund the withdrawal settlement received from the Fund, with compound interest, from the date the benefit was paid until the date of the election to restore        If a previous participant re-enters the Pension Fund after a break of less than 12 months, without having received any benefits, his/her entitlements and obligations as a participant continue.         Effective 1 July 1996, the length of contributory service which can be counted for calculating benefits, was increased to a maximum of 40 years.         In counting the years of contributory service, it should be kept in mind that the ‘normal’ age of retirement for those staff members who became participants in the Pension Fund on or before 31 December 1989 is 60, whereas the ‘normal’ age of retirement for staff members who became participants in the Pension Fund on or after 1 January 1990 is 62.         Continuation of Pension Participation         17. Whenever staff move from one organization to another, the UNJSPF should be contacted for details and conditions for continuation of pension participation.         Transfer of Pension Rights         18. A special agreement exists for transfer of pension rights between UNJSPF and the following organizations and governments:         Asian Development Bank     European Bank for Reconstruction and Development     European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts     European Communities     European Free Trade Association     European Space Agency     European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol)     Government of Canada     Inter-American Development Bank     International Monetary Fund     Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)     World Trade Organization         Choice of Benefits         19. When there is a choice of benefits (e.g., full periodic benefits, partial lump sum, final withdrawal settlement), participants should carefully consider what their choice would imply for themselves and for their families. Once acted upon by the Fund's secretariat, any decisions are irrevocable.                   ",
    "pensionable-remuneration": "Pensionable Remuneration    For the purposes of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), special scales, called \"Pensionable Remuneration\" (PR), are established as the basis for determining the contribution to be paid by the staff member and by UNDP as well as the pension benefits to which the staff member may become entitled.    The scale of PR currently in force is available at:     http://www.un.org/Depts/OHRM/salaries_allowances/salary.htm  or    http://icsc.un.org/secretariat/sad.asp?include=prs   The way in which Pensionable Remuneration is determined is defined in the Regulations of the Pension Fund. It is considered to be a gross amount, because it is assumed that the pension will be subject to national income tax and thus should be a gross value. (The Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, which provides for the non-taxability of UN salaries, does not apply to UN pensions.)    International Professional and Higher Categories     The scale of PR is adjusted from time to time according to a methodology agreed to by the General Assembly (GA). By this methodology, a certain percentage relationship between net remuneration (at the base of the system, New York) and PR is to be maintained, which is similar to the relationship between net and PR in the United States Federal Civil Service. Thus, typically, when the overall remuneration in New York rises as a result of an increase in post adjustment (or, less frequently, an overall increase in the salary scale), then the scale of PR goes up by the same percentage amount.    Effect of Change of Category on Pensionable Remuneration     When a staff member is promoted from the General Service (GS) or National Professional Officer (NPO) category to the International Professional category, the level of PR corresponding to the new grade and step is usually higher. If it would be lower than that which the staff member previously had, the previous level of PR is maintained for purposes of computing the staff member's pension benefits until it is eventually exceeded by the PR of the staff member's step and grade in the Professional category.       ",
    "performance-management-and-development": "Performance Management and Development  Structure Element - Description Objective    The objective of the Policy on Individual Performance Management and Development (PMD) is to facilitate successful performance of UNDP staff members, strengthen the culture of high-performance and continuous development, as well as ensure accountability of all UNDP staff members for effective performance.  Applicability   The Policy applies to all staff members in active UNDP service. A separate procedure is in place for the performance management of staff members at the ASG and above levels.  The Policy does not apply to staff members holding UNDP letters of appointment for service limited to another UN entity, unless the respective entity decides otherwise.  This Policy does not apply to a new UNDP staff member with an initial appointment of more than one year while on probation. UNDP staff members on probation will be subject to the Probation upon Appointment policy.   Key Provisions  A.\tPerformance  Successful performance of staff is key for UNDP’s organizational success and a prerequisite for a staff appointment and a career in UNDP.  All UNDP staff members are accountable to the Administrator for performing their functions and delivery of agreed results based on the highest standards of competence, integrity, ethics, and efficiency, in line with the UN values, Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service, Secretary-General’s Bulletin on the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of United Nations Staff Members, UN Staff Regulations and Rules, and UNDP policies (also see Section Accountability for Performance).   Staff members should have appropriate guidance, resources, and learning opportunities to ensure they can meet performance standards, achieve agreed goals and results, and meet their relevant development needs.  The performance of staff members is required to be regularly monitored through formal and informal reviews and is to be evaluated annually to ensure that the agreed goals are achieved, and that the required standards of performance and conduct are successfully met.  B. \tPerformance management and development (PMD)  Effective performance management and development of each staff member (PMD) are a shared responsibility of the supervisee and the supervisor (see Section Accountability for Performance Management for the specific accountabilities of the supervisee and the supervisor).   Performance management and development are continuous processes and are anchored in the frequent, two-way, open communication between the supervisor and the supervisee aimed to ensure the achievement of results, staff development, and the provision of timely and appropriate support. Both the supervisor and the supervisee are expected to initiate and engage in such communication.  Performance management and development should be guided by the principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, clear and achievable expectations, and open, regular and constructive feedback and support in an environment of trust and respect.  The annual performance management and development cycle is from 1 January to 31 December of the year and includes: annual performance planning (mandatory); regular performance discussions, including performance monitoring, feedback and coaching during the performance year; the mid-term review (MTR) (mandatory); and the annual performance review (APR) (mandatory) (see Performance Management Development Cycle and Timeline).   Performance management and development are facilitated by various mechanisms, including an on-line tool aimed to ensure that a requisite record of the key milestones of the performance management process (hereafter “on-line PMD tool”) is maintained, UNDP Talent Development Centre (TDC), relevant guidelines, and learning and reference materials.  Annual performance planning  Annual performance planning (referred to in Paragraph 11) is the first mandatory element of the PMD cycle. It should be done jointly by the supervisor and the supervisee at the beginning of the performance year, in line with the corporate planning calendar. It should include the formulation and agreement on: (1) individual performance goals aligned with the office/team workplan and supervisee’s functions, and (2) learning and development goals informed by the supervisee’s competency proficiency, performance expectations, development needs, and the staff member’s longer-term career aspirations and opportunities. The supervisor can also decide to assign additional goals to supervisees, in line with the office and team priorities. Both performance and learning and development goals should be recorded in the on-line PMD tool.  As members of the United Nations Country Team (UNCT), all UNDP Resident Representatives (RRs) will have a mandatory goal related to UNCT results. All other staff are encouraged to include such goals as relevant.  All supervisors will have a mandatory effective people management goal. All Heads of Offices, senior managers in Country Offices, Regional Hubs and HQs with delegated authority and accountability for budget and financial management should also have a goal on financial management.  In line with the commitments of the UNDP Gender Equality Strategy and Gender Parity Strategy, heads of offices will have a mandatory goal on gender equality and gender parity. All other managers and staff should include such goals as relevant.   A new UNDP staff member, with an initial appointment of one year or less, should have their first performance goals confirmed and recorded in the on-line PMD tool within the first two months of the appointment with UNDP. A staff member reassigned to a new position in UNDP should have their performance goals confirmed and recorded in the on-line PMD tool within the first two months of the reassignment. A new UNDP staff member with an initial appointment of more than one year will be subject to the Probation upon appointment policy.  Both the supervisor and the supervisee must participate in the annual planning process (referred to in paragraph 11). If the supervisor has not participated in the annual performance planning discussion or has not approved annual goals in the on-line PMD tool, the supervisor of the supervisor or, as needed, the Head of the Office should ensure that an appropriate solution is identified so that the performance review is finalized.   If the supervisee has not participated in the annual planning, the supervisor should finalize the goals and inform the supervisee accordingly. This should be done within the corporate timeline for the completion of the annual goal plans.  In case a disagreement between the supervisor and supervisee on the goals is not resolved by the corporate deadline, the supervisor of the supervisor or, as needed, the Head of the Office will decide on the final annual goal plan.   The annual goals may be modified during the performance year to ensure alignment with changing priorities, resource availability, necessity of services, and needs of the Organization. Modifications to the annual goals should be discussed by the supervisor and supervisee, recorded in the on-line PMD tool, and approved by the supervisor. Although preferred, agreement of the supervisee is not required to modify annual goals. However, the supervisee must be informed of the modification(s).     Performance monitoring   Performance monitoring is an on-going process and includes frequent formal and informal reviews/check-ins between the supervisor and the supervisee during the performance year. Such reviews can be initiated or requested by either the supervisor or the supervisee.  Periodic reviews/check-ins are important parts of the effective performance management and primarily aim to support staff members in achieving their goals through real-time feedback, coaching, guidance and other support. They may be used to acknowledge and recognize good performance, or identify and timely address any performance shortcomings, challenges that the staff member is facing, or potential setbacks in the achievement of goals.  Informal reviews/check-ins may be in person (e.g. regular one-on-one meetings) or through an exchange of emails, or any other form of communication. They should be organized as frequently as needed. Formal reviews/check-ins should be provided in writing and recorded in the on-line PMD tool. It is recommended but optional that at least two formal check-ins are conducted during the year, one between the annual planning exercise and the MTR, and one between the MTR and the annual performance review. More frequent formal check-ins may be conducted, as needed.   The MTR (referred to in Paragraph 11) and its record in the on-line PMD tool are mandatory for all UNDP staff members who have worked for UNDP for at least three months prior to the MTR time. Generally, it takes place in the middle of the performance year and provides a formal opportunity for the supervisor and the supervisee to review progress, clarify and adjust goals and expectations, discuss development and support needs, confirm priorities for the remainder of the year and changes in the annual plan, if any. MTR also provides a good opportunity to discuss staff member’s career aspirations and check-in on the implementation of the respective development goals.  MTRs of staff members with performance shortcomings should reflect comments on identified performance issues and include copies of Performance Improvement Plan(s) (PIP), (see 3.0 Procedure table “Dealing with Performance does not fully meet performance expectations”, step 1) where these already exist.   Annual performance review (APR)  In line with the UN Staff Regulations and Rules, an annual performance review (referred to in Paragraph 11) will take place to evaluate the performance of the staff members during the year, confirm the achievement of agreed goals and other performance expectations, demonstrated competency proficiency, and review development needs (see 3.0 Procedure table “Annual Performance Review”, step 4).   The APR and its record in the on-line PMD tool are mandatory for all UNDP staff members who have worked for UNDP for at least six months during the performance year.    Prior to the APR, additional feedback may be requested by the supervisor from others (e.g. peers, other managers, clients, etc.). Such feedback should be, but is not required to be, requested following consultation with the supervisee on which people could provide such feedback. Requesting additional feedback from others is optional and can be done at any time during the year, as appropriate. For staff members with supervisory responsibilities, feedback from the personnel they supervise is strongly encouraged.  For UNDP Resident Representatives, feedback on their performance as members of the UNCT and their contribution to UNCT results will be requested from the UN Resident Coordinators or other appropriate authority and be taken into account in the APR of the RRs.  Supervisors are expected to exercise rigor in performance reviews, provide meaningful comments, and, as appropriate, include critical incidents of exceptional or deficient performance.   Supervisors are required to submit recommendations on supervisees who should receive a certificate of special recognition to their supervisor for endorsement and then to the Head of the Office for approval.  Supervisors are also required to provide clarifications to the Talent Management Committee (TMC), as needed, regarding the performance of supervisees who received a performance rating of ‘Does not fully meet performance expectations’.   Upon request from a staff member, the TMC reviews the outcome of performance reviews that received a ‘Does not fully meet performance expectations’ rating. The TMC is not required to separately endorse each of the reviews for individual staff members. However, the TMC will have the authority to discuss and change the final outcome of the annual performance review for a staff member, if necessary, as a result of a request by the supervisee.   Comments by the TMC, if any, are required to be recorded in the on-line PMD tool and make up part of a formal performance record of the respective staff members. The TMC will not address the questions of renewal of a staff member appointment or of awarding the within-grade salary increment in its comments.  If the supervisor leaves the organization, they are required to complete the mandatory performance reviews of the supervisees they supervised or share their comments on the supervisees’ performance with the new supervisor, as part of the separation or the inter-agency move process.   If the supervisor is reassigned to a different position in UNDP, they are required to complete the mandatory performance reviews of their supervisees in their previous position or share their comments on the supervisees’ performance with the new supervisor.   If the current or former supervisor does not complete the mandatory performance review of the supervisee within 30 calendar days of the corporate deadline, the supervisor of the supervisor or, as needed, the Head of the Office will finalize the performance review, based on relevant inputs. (See Section on Accountability for Performance Management for provisions on non-compliance of supervisors with obligations related to performance management, including the completion of the annual performance review).    If a supervisee does not provide their input into the performance review until 5 days before the corporate deadline, the supervisor should complete their review without that input. In exceptional cases, the supervisee can request an extension of the timeline to be approved by the Head of the Office. (See Section on Accountability for Performance Management for provisions on non-compliance of supervisees with obligations related to performance management, including providing inputs for performance reviews.)   Recognizing successful performance  Recognition of and rewarding successful performance is a good management practice and, as such should be an integral part of regular interaction between supervisors and supervisees.  A review of the recent Annual Performance reviews is a part of any recruitment/selection process, and other similar processes, and is expected to be balanced with other means of candidate assessment, such as technical tests, interviews and others.  Pursuant to Annex I, paragraph 4 of the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rule 3.2, only staff members with satisfactory service will receive a within-grade salary increment.  Staff members with exceptional performance may receive a certificate of special recognition. Such certificates will be signed by the Head of Bureau/Office and uploaded to the on-line PMD tool by the supervisor. For a supervisee to receive a certificate of special recognition, the supervisor’s recommendation must be endorsed by their supervisor. If the person reports to the Head of Office, then the Head of Office would provide the final endorsement.  Addressing performance that does not fully meet performance expectations   It is expected that most issues related to staff performance are identified and addressed informally as part of the on-going performance monitoring during the performance year.  If the supervisor considers that the supervisee’s continued performance may result in a ‘Does not fully meet performance expectations’ overall rating, the supervisor should notify the supervisee in writing of the performance shortcomings, discuss expected improvements and timelines, work with the supervisee on the creation of a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), and inform the supervisee of the consequences of non-compliance, as per this Policy. Prior to notifying the supervisee of the need to create a PIP, approval from the supervisor of the supervisor or the Head of Office must be obtained. If the person reports to the Head of Office, then the Head of Office would provide the final endorsement.  A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is a tool that aims to facilitate the required improvement in the performance of a staff member. It serves to record: (1) identified shortcomings and improvements to be achieved, (2) actions to be taken to fully meet the requirements of the job and performance objectives, (3) timelines; as well as (4) support to be provided, (5) outcomes of periodic check-ins, and (6) the final review of the PIP implementation.  The creation of a PIP should be initiated by the supervisors and finalized within ten working days from the supervisor’s notification of the need to create a PIP. If the supervisor and the supervisee are unable to agree on the terms of the PIP, or the supervisee refuses to participate in the PIP discussions, a decision on the terms of the PIP will be made by the supervisor of the supervisor or Head of Office. If the person reports to the Head of Office, then the Head of Office would provide the final endorsement.  PIPs are generally of 3 months each and there could be more than one within a performance year. It is important to ensure that agreed support is provided to the supervisee during the PIP implementation.     If improvement in performance is not achieved in line with the established expectations and within the established timeline set in the two consecutive PIP(s), or if the staff member refuses to comply with the PIP, the appointment of such staff member may be terminated or not renewed, in accordance with the applicable UN Staff Regulations and Rules and UNDP policies. The two consecutive PIPs need not be in the course of one performance year as long as the PIPs are not separated by more than a six-month period of time.  Notifications, key performance-related shortcomings, performance improvement needs, remedial measures and timelines should be properly recorded in the on-line PMD tool and other documents such as emails and notes to file, as appropriate.   If unsatisfactory performance is observed within the first year of service in UNDP, the generally recommended time for performance improvement and implementation of remedial measures can be reduced. A new UNDP staff member with an initial appointment of more than one year will be subject to the Probation upon appointment policy.   Resolution of disputes  Supervisees who do not agree with the results of the annual performance review by the supervisor must request that TMC considers their case. The request for the TMC review should be made within 10 working days of the date that the supervisee received the notification of the completion of the performance review by the supervisor from the on-line PMD tool. Such supervisees can provide additional information for the TMC to review, as needed.  If a supervisee does not agree with the final annual performance review as confirmed by the TMC, they may submit a formal request for rebuttal. Recourse to the rebuttal process does not suspend the outcome of the performance review until the final rebuttal decision. A request for rebuttal must be submitted within 15 working days from the date they are notified of the final decision of the TMC. Exceptions can be made in cases when in the opinion of the Chair of the Rebuttal Panel circumstances are beyond the control of the supervisee.   Only the performance reviews with the 'does not fully meet performance expectations’ rating may be rebutted. Consideration by the TMC is a mandatory step before the submission of a rebuttal request.   Each rebuttal request is to be considered by the Rebuttal Panel (hereinafter “Panel”, see 3.0 Procedure table “Rebuttal”, step 1 for the Terms of Reference of the Rebuttal Panel).  The results of the review by the Panel are to be captured in the Panel Report, which constitutes the final outcome of the annual performance management process.    Decisions on a performance rating are only final once the Chair of the Rebuttal Panel has rendered a decision on the rebuttal request. Thus any further appeal by a supervisee against a performance rating should follow the decision of the Chair of the Rebuttal Panel on the performance rating of the supervisee who requested rebuttal. Similarly, the decision on the award of the within grade increment are only final once the decision is rendered by the Director, OHR.   In the event of complaints to the Office of Audit and Investigations related to wrongdoing in the context of performance management, the performance review process will be suspended pending the outcome of that complaint to OAI. In the event of a formal appeal as a request for management evaluation or to the UN Tribunals on issues related to performance, consideration before the TMC or Rebuttal Panel depending on the stage of the process, will also be suspended.  Proceedings may furthermore be suspended if, in the opinion of the TMC Chair or the Chair of the Rebuttal Panel depending on the stage of the supervisee appeal, the circumstances warrant suspension.  Accountability for performance   Continued appointment with UNDP is contingent on an overall rating of ‘Successfully meets performance expectations’.   If the performance of the staff member does not fully meet performance expectations, their appointment may be terminated or not renewed. The decision on termination or non-renewal of the UNDP appointment will take into account the results of the latest mid-term and annual performance reviews and the implementation of PIPs.   Staff members whose performance is rated as 'Does not fully meet performance expectations’ will not be awarded the next within-grade salary increment when it is otherwise due. Decisions not to award or to recover the within-grade salary increment will be approved by the Director of OHR.  In case a rebuttal of the outcome of the annual performance review is requested by the staff member, the rebuttal decision will be factored into the decision not to award a within-grade salary increment, or not to renew or to terminate the appointment, where non-renewal or termination of appointment is being considered for performance reasons.   If the within-grade increment is due to be awarded in the next performance cycle and the due date occurs before the decision on the annual performance review for the previous performance cycle (whether after the rebuttal process or earlier, if there is no rebuttal), the increment will generally be awarded when it is due pending the subsequent decision on the annual performance review. If such a decision confirms that the staff member has not fully met performance expectations, the increment may be recovered by the Organization retroactive to the date when it was awarded. If the within-grade increment is due to be awarded in the next performance cycle and the due date occurs after the decision on the annual performance review for the previous performance cycle (whether after the rebuttal process or earlier, if there is no rebuttal), the increment may be awarded only on that due date.     Pursuant to Staff Rule 13.2(d), if the necessities of service require abolition of a post or reduction of the staff and subject to the availability of suitable posts for which their services can be effectively utilized, staff members with permanent appointments shall be retained in preference to those on all other types of appointments, provided that due regard shall be given in all cases to relative competence, integrity and length of service. In line with the present Policy, satisfactory performance will constitute one more key condition.  Accountability for performance management  The Assistant Administrator of the Bureau for Management Services (BMS) has the overall authority over performance management policies and processes in UNDP.   Bureaus Directors and Heads of Offices are accountable for effective performance management in their respective Bureaus/Offices. They are expected to promote regular communication between supervisors and supervisees in their teams, encourage ongoing feedback and discussion, and make sure that changes in the mandate or priorities of UNDP, Bureau or Office are clearly communicated to all staff members to ensure alignment.   The supervisor is accountable for the performance management in their teams/offices, both in terms of process and quality. In particular, the supervisor should:   engage in regular discussions with supervisees about work and performance; appropriately guide and coach supervisees for performance, development, and potential career development options;   ensure that each supervisee has annual performance goals defined on time and aligned with the office/team workplan;  initiate and participate in formal and informal performance reviews and check-ins, with a view to monitoring the achievement of goals, identifying performance gaps and needs, and ensuring required support;  ensure that a mandatory mid-term review is completed for all supervisees;  support the implementation of their supervisees’ learning and development plans and ensure their appropriate alignment with the requirements of the supervisees’ current jobs as well as their career development aspirations, potential opportunities, and needs;  complete mandatory annual performance reviews for all supervisees in their team on time;  ensure development of PIP(s), if needed, and support their implementation;  ensure that the resources and tools at the disposal of the supervisee are commensurate with goals/results to be achieved and other expectations, as per the Job Description; ensure that the supervisee has access to requisite training/learning resources;  actively promote and support an inclusive, respectful, psychologically safe and enabling working environment that fosters open communication regarding performance and work-related issues.  The supervisee should:  engage in regular discussions with the supervisor about work and performance; proactively seek support and guidance required for successful achievement of goals/results;  discuss with the supervisor and draft, on time, their annual performance goals aligned with the office/team workplan;  participate in and provide required information for various formal and informal performance discussions and reviews, including drafting the statement of annual achievement and acknowledging reviews;   embrace feedback constructively and make an active effort to address issues, as needed;  implement a Performance Improvement Plan, if required;  take charge of their development and, as such, formulate and implement learning and development goals/plans.   Unless there are compelling reasons beyond the control of the supervisor or supervisee, failure to comply with the above obligations should be reflected in the performance review of the supervisor and/or of the supervisee.    Timelines for the completion of the key performance management milestones for staff members with extended absence (for example, staff members on an extended sick leave, or staff members on maternity leave) are to be adjusted accordingly.  Documenting performance  Key milestones related to the annual performance of UNDP staff members, including annual goals, mid-term reviews, and annual performance reviews are required to be documented and recorded in the on-line PMD tool (other reviews should be recorded, as needed).  To ensure continuity, PMD documents in the on-line PMD tool and other performance records for each staff member are maintained and archived in accordance with UNDP standards for human resources information management.  Other provisions  The standard performance management processes can be suspended during the investigation and any subsequent disciplinary proceedings, as appropriate, by a decision of the Director of OHR following consultation with the Legal Office. If the final investigation report, as received by the Legal Office, and the circumstances of the case have shown unsatisfactory performance and/or poor judgement not amounting to misconduct on the part of the staff member, a reprimand or comments on performance where the staff member’s conduct did not rise to the level of misconduct but nevertheless demonstrated performance shortcomings may be recorded in the PMD on-line tool.    Definitions  Formal reviews are reviews that are conducted in writing and may be proceeded or followed by a discussion between the supervisee and their supervisor. Formal reviews include, for example, a mid-term performance review, an annual performance review, a review on progress in the implementation of PIP, and the like.  Informal reviews are discussions about the performance of the supervisee without a formal record in writing, e.g. discussions at regular one-on-one meetings.  Performance shortcomings are documented instances of performance that do not meet the required standards of performance.  Not fully meeting performance expectations is where a supervisee has demonstrably fallen short of the requirements of their position, including expected performance standards, required competency proficiency, or their status as a UN staff member.  Successfully meeting performance expectations is where a supervisee meets all or most of the performance expectations, displays the required competency proficiency, and honors their status as a UN staff member.

    "post-adjustment": "Post Adjustment      The Post Adjustment system was designed to equalize purchasing power of United Nations salaries for professionals and higher categories, taking into account the cost of living differences between the base city of the system (New York) and other duty stations. The system aims at ensuring that, no matter where United Nations common system staff work at some 180 locations worldwide, their take-home-pay has a purchasing power equivalent to that at the base of the system.      The Post Adjustment System is available at: http://icsc.un.org/secretariat/cold.asp?include=par   ",
    "principles-remuneration": "Principles of Remuneration    The remuneration of staff members is established in accordance with the United Nations (UN) Common System of Salaries and Allowances. The Common System is the arrangement by which most organizations of the UN system have agreed to follow a single, coordinated set of salaries and allowances for their staff. The Common System organizations include the UN, its subsidiary organizations, and the specialized agencies. Not included in this arrangement are the Bretton Woods institutions, i.e., the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and their affiliated organizations (organizations that have not agreed to be covered by the UN Common System of Salaries and Allowances).    The purpose of this Common System approach is to avoid undue competition among UN agencies for staff, while at the same time facilitating movement (by means of secondments, loans, and transfers) between agencies. The main elements of the pay system (salaries and allowances) come under the Common System, as do the pension system and other main social security benefits. The General Assembly (GA) and the legislative organs of the other UN system agencies have agreed that the conditions of the staff of the different organizations will be governed by the coordinated system. It has also been accepted by the different organizations that the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) is to play a central role in harmonizing and regulating the conditions of service among Common System organizations.    Through the decisions of the various governing bodies, through the decisions and recommendations of the ICSC, and through the coordinated deliberations of the High Level Committee on Management (HLCM), the allowances and benefits that are covered by the Common System include, inter alia, the following: base salary; the post adjustment and rental subsidy/deduction system; mobility and hardship allowance (MHA), dependency allowances, education grant (EG) and travel (EGT); assignment grant (AG) arrangements; shipping and insurance entitlements; separation benefits; annual leave (AL) and home leave (HL) provisions; retirement and disability provisions; and danger pay.     Despite the attempt to coordinate most of the broad package of benefits, there are, nevertheless, some benefits that do not come under the Common System of salaries and allowances. For these ‘excluded’ benefits, either the organizations have agreed that it is not necessary to have coordination conditions or the organizations have ‘agreed to disagree’. Some of the benefits not falling within the Common System are: medical insurance, benefits for language proficiency, merit awards, and use of business class travel.        Noblemaire Principle (for International Professional and Higher Categories)     The remuneration of staff is based on the \"Noblemaire Principle\" (from the name of the Chairman of a Committee of the League of Nations, which first formulated it in 1920). This principle holds that an international organization must remunerate its entire staff equally for work of equal value, irrespective of differences in levels of pay in the various countries from which they are drawn. It must also be able to recruit and retain staff from all its member states. Consequently, the uniform level of pay it provides must be sufficient to attract staff from the country or countries where national pay levels are highest.    The principle has been applied in practice since the establishment of the UN system by taking, as the single point of reference for setting the level of UN remuneration, the pay of the home civil service of the United States of America (USA), which is normally the highest paid.     In the application of this principle, a comparison is made between the remuneration level (net salary plus post adjustment) for UN staff in New York and the salary level for US federal civil servants in Washington, D.C., for a range of jobs and grades that have been found to be at similar levels of responsibility. An adjustment is made for the costof-living differential between the two cities. With the assistance of ICSC, the GA monitors this remuneration comparison on a regular basis and approves adjustments in salary from time to time. In doing so, the GA allows for a margin of pay between the two services to be approximately 15 percent, in favour of the UN pay in New York. The justification for this ‘margin’ of difference has traditionally been based on three factors:     The largely expatriate nature of UN system service    The shorter career in the UN system, due to a higher average age of recruitment    The more limited promotion prospects in the UN system    The annual reports of the ICSC provide information about the various studies undertaken in this connection, particularly about the manner in which the comparison is made between US and UN salaries.     The application of the Noblemaire Principle and the consequent ‘margin comparison’ described above result in the setting and monitoring of salary levels at the base of the UN salary system, which is New York. To ensure appropriate pay levels at other duty stations, the post adjustment system is maintained for the purpose of providing similar ‘purchasing power parity’ as compared to New York.    While the UN salary system continues to be based on the comparison with a single national civil service, reputed to be normally the best, attention has been given in recent years to the possibility of taking other reference points into consideration. Other international civil services (which certainly did not exist back in the days of the League of Nations when the Noblemaire Principle was enunciated) do exist today and do compete with the UN system for qualified staff. For that matter, it is also understood today that the UN international civil service draws its staff from a much wider network than civil services alone. These and other considerations have encouraged an ongoing debate about the appropriate way to apply the Noblemaire Principle in the modern environment.     Fleming Principle (for Locally Recruited Staff Members)     The remuneration of local staff members is based on the “Fleming Principle” (from the name of the Chairman of the Committee that first enunciated it in 1948). This principle advocates that these staff should be compensated in accordance with the best prevailing conditions of service found locally for similar work. This ensures that the UN remains a competitive employer able to attract and retain high-calibre staff. In practice, the salaries and conditions of service of locally recruited staff members are established by reference to those of the presumed best employers in the locality, identified by means of a survey.     The salaries of local staff are set on the basis of a single scale applicable to all locally recruited staff members at a particular duty station.    ",
    "probation-upon-appointment": " Probation Upon Appointment This policy provides the framework guidance on the administration of a probationary period to the initial fixed term appointment of UNDP staff members where that initial appointment exceeds one year.  Purpose The purpose of the policy is to create a framework to ensure that newly recruited staff members on appointments exceeding one year can fully demonstrate their suitability as international civil servants and show that they meet the high standards of efficiency, competence and integrity established in the Charter of the United Nations.  This policy applies to all new UNDP fixed term appointments, including for staff members being transferred or seconded to UNDP under the Inter-Organization Agreement concerning Transfer, Secondment or Loan of Staff among the Organizations Applying the United Nations Common System Salaries and Allowances on any type of appointment of more than one year. It does not apply to staff members appointed by UNDP on behalf of other UN entities or staff members with service limited to such entities. Probationary period  All initial fixed term appointments of more than one year are subject to a probationary period of one year in the first year of appointment.  Previous service on a temporary appointment, service or individual contract will not shorten or waive any subsequent probationary period to be served on a new fixed term appointment of more than one year; Staff members transferred or seconded to UNDP on any type of appointment of more than one year are subject to a probationary period of one year in the first year of appointment; Staff members previously employed by UNDP, who re-join UNDP after a break in service of one year or more, are subject to a probationary period of one year in the first year of appointment.  The probationary period may be extended exceptionally up to 18 months when, in the judgment of the supervisor, more time is required to determine the staff member's performance or suitability (e.g., due to the staff member's absence on sick leave or parental leave).     In the event that a staff member is promoted or transferred to a different post while still on probation, the staff member does not start a new probationary period but continues to serve on probation after promotion or transfer provided, however, that the total probationary period does not exceed 18 months. Assessment of performance during probation Confirmation of a staff member’s appointment is dependent upon satisfactory completion of their probationary period including such elements as (i) satisfactory performance of the duties and responsibilities assigned to them; and (ii) and satisfactory conduct and suitability for the International Civil Service. Unless the interests of UNDP compel the staff member's separation before completion of the probationary period, the one-year probationary period includes a plan of work and two review periods to be reported upon. The following schedule should be observed closely:  Work plan (within three weeks of entry on duty): the first level supervisor discusses the job description with the staff member and provides them with a plan of work embracing the duties to be performed or objectives and tasks to be completed within the probationary period;   First review period (no later than six months after entry on duty): the first level supervisor completes a Probationary Performance Appraisal Report, and discusses it with the staff member, who may request that the staff member’s observations be attached to the report. It is then recorded in the staff member's personal performance and development file via the on-line PMD tool, accessible to the staff member;  Second review period (no later than ten months after entry on duty): the first level supervisor completes the Probationary Performance Appraisal Report for the second review period. The second level supervisor decides whether to: a) confirm the appointment, b) extend the probationary period or c) not confirm the appointment. The report is again shown to and discussed with the staff member, who may request that the staff member’s observations be attached to the report. The staff member's observations, if any, are included in the staff member’s personal performance and development file.  Non-cooperation by the staff member with the probationary process or the assessment schedule agreed to, may lead to the termination of the appointment.   Exceptions to the assessment schedule in Paragraph 7 may be granted by the Director, Office of Human Resources (OHR).      Confirmation of appointment  If the second level supervisor confirms the appointment, the report, including any attachments, is kept in the staff member’s personal performance and development file.  Extension of Probationary Period If the second level supervisor decides that the extension of the probationary period is warranted, OHR is informed of the reasons for the extension and is provided with a copy of the Probationary Performance Appraisal Report, together with any observations of the staff member. If the probationary period is extended:   The first within-grade salary increment is suspended for the staff member concerned and is granted retroactively to the staff member if the appointment is subsequently confirmed.  A further plan of work is established by the first level supervisor covering the period of extension. At the end of the extension, a recommendation is made by the second level supervisor to confirm the appointment or terminate the staff member’s appointment.  Copies of the report, work plan and other relevant documents are kept in the staff member’s personal performance and development file.  Termination of appointment If the second level supervisor considers that termination of the appointment is in UNDP’s interest because the probationary period was not satisfactorily completed, the staff member must be notified in writing, no later than six weeks prior to the date the probationary period expires.  The staff member has five working days following receipt of the written notice in paragraph 12 in which to comment to the second level supervisor. A copy of the staff member's comments is sent to OHR, along with any supporting documentation.   After consideration of the staff member's reply or, failing such reply, at the close of the five-day period, the second level supervisor submits a recommendation for termination of appointment to the Director, OHR, who forwards it to the Assistant Administrator and Director, Bureau for Management Services (BMS) for decision.   The Director, OHR advises the second level supervisor concerned and the staff member of the decision taken. Copies of the report, the notification and other relevant documents are included in the staff member's personnel file.  ",
    "rank-post": "Rank-in-Post  1.\tRank-in-post is a system by which staff are graded and paid for their expected contribution.   2.\tRank-in-post replaces the previous promotion policy which was based on personal promotion or “rank-in-person”.   3.\tRank-in-post is established to assist UNDP in attracting and retaining the best possible workforce in a constantly changing development environment. It also allows UNDP to align its human resources management more closely to United Nations common system partners thereby achieving greater harmonization, particularly in the context of inter-agency mobility. 4.\tRank-in-post means that a serving staff member who is competitively selected for a post classified and budgeted at a higher level, for an expected period of one year or longer, is automatically promoted to that higher level immediately upon assumption of the higher level duties. There are no qualifying periods and no seniority requirements and no promotion bodies to recommend approval. Only candidates meeting the pre-defined requirements for a post as per the job description can be selected.  5.\tRank-in-post is based on standardized classification of jobs and transparent recruitment and selection processes, with oversight exercised by the relevant Compliance Review Bodies i.e. Compliance Review Board (CRB) or Compliance Review Panel (CRP) (see paragraph 2.9 below).  Hiring units will be responsible for strictly complying with the corporate procedures on classification, recruitment, reassignment and selection, to ensure that only candidates with “the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity” as required by the Charter of the United Nations and who possess the right skills, experience and competencies required for the properly classified and budgeted posts are selected.   6.\tRank-in-post relies on a transparent and rigorous selection process.  As such, it is expected that all recruitments and selections will strictly follow established rules and procedures as outlined in the UNDP Recruitment and Selection Framework.        Scope of Application 7.\tThe Rank-in-post policy applies to the following post levels: General Service (GS/ICS 1–7), National Officers (NOA-D/ICS 8-11), Professional (P 1-6/ICS 8–13) and Director level 1 (D1/ICS 13). Rank-in-post applies equally to UNDP staff holding Permanent Appointments (PA), Continuing Appointments (CA) and Fixed-Term Appointments (FTA) for service with UNDP.  8.\tRank-in-post does not apply to: P7/D2 (ICS-14)level posts: promotion to P7/D2-level posts remains, as always, the prerogative of the Administrator; the P7/D2 promotions are based on recommendations from the Senior CRG and dependent on budgetary parameters and on approved numbers of P7/D2 positions within the Biennial Support Budget (BSB) as reviewed by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Question (ACABQ) and decided upon by the Executive Board (EB); Posts under the Candidate Pools i.e. RR/DRR selections which are subject to EG Review and the Administrator’s approval posts established for Temporary Appointments (TA): TA are established for activities of limited duration at a given classified level and TA holders will keep the level of the post for the duration of the activities for which they have been appointed; a TA holder needs to be competitively selected to get a TA post of a higher level in accordance with the rules and conditions outlined in the UNDP TA Guidelines or to get an FTA post; c)\t UNDP staff members holding higher level posts in another organization, agency, fund or programme, through an inter-agency mobility movement, like a loan, a secondment, an exchange, a Non Reimbursable Loan, a mission assignment to DPKO, etc.; upon their return to UNDP they will revert to the grade they had before leaving UNDP irrespective of the grade they had in the other organization, agency, fund or programme, unless they are competitively selected to a higher level post with UNDP;   d)\tStaff administered by UNDP and those holding UNDP letters of appointment for service limited to another organization, agency, fund or programme. However, rank-in-post may apply to such staff if it is explicitly requested by their parent, organization, agency, fund or programme;   e)\tJunior Professional Officers: their placement to UNDP posts are governed by the terms and agreements reached between UNDP and their sponsoring countries; and f)\t Non-staff categories, i.e. Service Contracts (SC), Individual contractors (IC), UN Volunteers (UNV), etc. Determining level 9.\tRank-in-post is based on a rigorous selection process where only qualified candidates are selected [link to Recruitment and Selection Framework].  Therefore, Rank-in-post means that staff are appointed at the budgeted and classified level of the post for which they have been competitively selected upon assumption of their new functions irrespective of their previous personal level.   Consistency between the level of the post, the qualifications of the selected candidate and the level of appointment 10.\tIt has become occasional practice to recruit an individual who does not meet all the requirements for a post in the expectation that he/she will eventually develop the necessary competencies or acquire the minimum qualifications for the post.  As a result, hiring units have at times placed the selected candidate to a lower level than the post as classified and advertised. This practice is to be discontinued.  Rank-in-post requires consistency between the level of the classified post, the qualifications of the selected candidate to that post and the grade to which he/she is placed. This is essential in order for UNDP to maintain corporate standards across its entire workforce for establishing consistent grade levels for comparable contributions. Therefore, in the event that a fully qualified candidate cannot be found following a competitive selection process, either the hiring unit re-advertises the post with the view of getting additional applications, or has the job description revised and reclassified at a lower grade and proceeds with a new advertisement and selection process.   Determining salary 11.\tIn accordance with Staff Rule 3.4 (b) a staff member selected to a higher level position “shall be placed at the lowest step of the level to which he/she has been promoted that provides an increase in net base salary equal to at least the amount that would have resulted from the granting of two steps at the lower level.”   Changing categories 12.\tThe following will apply when setting steps for staff appointed to different categories:  All (PA, CA, FTA and TA) locally recruited staff members in country offices who are competitively selected and appointed to a different category (G to P and NO to P) will be given the level of the post for which they have been competitively selected, applying the same criteria established in Staff Rule 3.4 (b).  All staff on a Professional level post who are competitively selected for a Director level post will have their step set according to Staff Rule 3.4 (b).  GS staff in Headquarters offices who are selected to a higher level position in the P category (G to P) will have their step set according to Staff Rule 3.4.  13.\tAdministratively, all PAs, CAs and FTAs selected for higher level FTA posts will retain their original Entry on Duty date (EOD) and will carry over any remaining leave balances.  Pension Fund participation will be considered as continuous.  Moreover, when an appointment to a different category results in a reduction of pensionable remuneration (PR) according to the established salary scale, an adjustment will be made to ensure the staff member’s actual PR remains unreduced.  Staff will not retain a lien to their previous post when competitively selected for and undertake another post at a different category.    Post reclassifications  14.\tAll posts reclassified must be advertised for competitive selection. The reason for reclassifying a position is dependent on requirements of the functions, and not about the incumbent. A job is designed based on complexity and the business needs of a unit and is classified in accordance with the ICSC job classification standards.  15.\tAll classification requests must include a detailed justification and contextual information, including the budget, information pertaining to the approved numbers of positions; of the new business needs of the unit, as well as both the old and the new job description and an updated, detailed, organizational chart showing the affected post(s) in question and other posts impacted by the proposed action. 16.\tPost levels have budgetary implications and must be managed consistently across the Organization. Consequently, revised business processes have been put in place to strengthen the job classification system in UNDP.  The budget clearance, along with position management (in terms of approved numbers), is a pre-requisite of any (re)classification request. Furthermore, the relevant units involved in centralized or decentralized classifications (OHR, OFM, Executive Office, Headquarters Bureaux or Offices, Country Offices) will be accountable for consistently and transparently applying standardized classification criteria.  17.\tIf the reclassification takes place in the context of change management (re-organization or re-alignment), please contact your corresponding Business Partner. If the reclassification is not related to a change management exercise but concerns an individual post or a few individual posts the following applies: Upon receipt of the budget clearance and reclassification decision, the hiring unit is required to advertise the position without delay with the view of completing the recruitment process within three months.  As good HR practice, hiring units are encouraged to seek the reclassification of an individual post when the post is vacated or about to be vacated.  However, if the post which has been reclassified is occupied by a FTA, CA or PA staff member and is advertised, the incumbent will be invited to apply for the reclassified post, his/her application will receive priority consideration and if he/she is found suitable, he/she may be selected for the post irrespective of his/her ranking in the selection process.  If the incumbent is not selected for the reclassified post, the hiring unit will be required to provide to the CRB/CRP substantiated reasons for not considering him/her suitable for the post, and the procedures related to abolition of post will apply.  Reclassifications more than one level upward or downward will have to be confirmed and approved by the OHR Classification Unit.  An upward reclassification of more than one level represents, essentially, a new job requiring an appropriate selection process for which many incumbents may not realistically be eligible.  This would then constitute an abolition of post and a new post creation.  Similarly, when a post is downgraded more than one level, the same principles apply.     Special Post Allowance  18.\tA staff member (other than a TA) who is temporarily (i.e. for a period not exceeding one year) assigned to a higher level post, or is temporarily required to perform higher level functions while remaining on his/her current post may be granted a non-pensionable Special Post Allowance (SPA) after completion of 3 months of continuous service at the higher level functions, subject to confirmation in writing by the supervisor that the staff member is indeed performing at the higher level.  19.\tThe reason for the three-month grace period is that, from time to time and as part of their normal duties, staff may be expected to temporarily assume higher level functions (during periods of absence, for instance).  20.\tHowever, (i) when a staff member is temporarily assigned to a post more than one level above their personal grade or to a different category or (ii) when the temporary assignment is in a D or E hardship category, SPA may be granted by the supervisor with immediate effect and will not have to wait three months provided that the supervisor confirms that the staff member is performing all the responsibilities attached to the higher position.  21.\tWhen staff are assigned temporarily to a job more than one grade above, and in particular to a job at a higher category, an SPA may be approved only by the relevant Bureau Director.  SPAs should only be approved when the staff member performs and is accountable for the full range of responsibilities of the higher level post.  Temporary grades 22.\tTemporary grades within UNDP are abolished. However, UNDP staff members holding temporary grades as the result of an inter-agency movement to another organization, agency, fund or programme, will keep that temporary grade in that other organization, agency, fund or programme. Upon their return to UNDP they will revert to the grade held in UNDP prior to their departure on interagency movement, unless they are competitively selected to a higher level position with UNDP.    Appointment to a lower level post 23.\tWhen a staff member by his/her own choice applies for a lower level post than the post he/she is currently encumbering, he/she will be appointed at the level of the post to which he/she is selected. 24.\tHowever, the staff member will  retain his/her personal grade for three months when (i) in the context of a realignment or abolishment of post or if unassigned he/she had no other choice than to apply for a lower level post to retain employment with the organization, or (ii) his/her profile is considered of critical value to meet an organizational need in a lower level post.  Compliance Review Body (CRB) and Compliance Review Panel (CRP)  25.\tUnder Rank-in-Post policy, promotion to a higher level post and selection to a post of the same grade level (lateral move) are based on UNDPs recruitment and selection policies. The CRB/CRP checks the compliance of the selection process with the applicable Staff Rules, the UNDP Recruitment and Selection Framework and related policies.  26.\tWhen a recommended selection entails a promotion of more than one grade level (e.g. G4 to G6, or NOA to NOC, or P3 to P5, or P4 to D1/P6) the review will be broader and will consider, inter alia, whether other qualified staff one grade below were given due consideration.  In a Rank-in-post environment, such cases are expected to be rare and exceptional.   Recourse  27.\tSince, under Rank-in-post, there is no promotion decision, only a selection decision, there is no longer any provision for promotion recourse. ‘One-Up’ promotions 28.\tIn order to meet strategic objectives and operational needs, ‘one-up’ promotions for senior and middle manager level international posts may be granted on an exceptional and discretionary basis by the Administrator/Associate Administrator, based on substantiated recommendations from the CRG/Senior CRG.  Personal promotions will not exceed budgetary parameters as set out in the Biennial Support Budget as reviewed by the ACABQ and decided upon by the Executive Board and five percent of the total number of established/budgeted posts in the relevant grade.   Retaining Personal Grades 29.\tStaff who, as the result of the previous Rank-in-person promotion policy, encumber lower level posts than their personal grade on 1st July 2008 will retain their personal grade. OHR/BMS will review their individual situations on a case-by-case basis.  ",
    "recovery-overpayments": " Recovery of Overpayments    The purpose of this policy is to inform staff members of the actions taken by the Organization when recovering overpayments resulting from an indebtedness to the organization by current and former staff members.    This policy concerns the recovery of overpayments, not recovery of advances that are recovered immediately and in full against the monthly payments received by staff members.      The following definitions apply for the purposes of the present section:    Overpayments: Payments made by the Organization to a staff member in excess of his/her salary, benefits and entitlements under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules and relevant policies; Advances: Advance payments received by a staff member from the Organization that are authorized under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules and relevant policies; Monthly payments: Monthly earnings of a staff member less payroll deductions, excluding those deductions made at the request of the staff member for payment to the United Federal Credit Union (UNFCU) or a similar institution.  Applicability    The present policy applies to all staff members governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, including staff members who have been separated.    Discovery of Overpayment     When the Organization discovers that an overpayment has been made, the office responsible for the determination and administration of the entitlement will immediately notify the staff member and process the recovery. That office will keep a record of such notification.     If a staff member discovers that an overpayment has occurred, he/she must notify immediately:     If an internationally recruited staff member stationed outside New York, the Copenhagen HR Specialist serving the duty station; or   If a locally recruited staff member stationed outside New York, the HR focal point at the duty station; or   If an internationally or locally recruited staff member stationed in New York, the Copenhagen HR Specialist serving the organizational unit.     Amounts to be recovered    Overpayments will normally be recovered in full. However, when the HR Specialist or Resident Representative, as the case may be, determines that the overpayment resulted from an administrative error on the part of the Organization and that the staff member was unaware of or could not reasonably have been expected to be aware of the overpayment, recovery of the overpayment will be limited to the amounts paid during the two-year period prior to:     The notification by the Organization (as per paragraph 5 above); or   The notification by the staff member (as per paragraph 6 above), if earlier.     Any overpayment in excess of the same entitlement that may be made after the date of notification will be recovered in full.    The two-year limitation provided in paragraph 7 will not apply when the facts indicate that the overpayment was due to the submission of erroneous, fraudulent or incomplete information, or misrepresentation by the staff member.  In such cases, the overpayment will be recovered in full.   Method of Recovery     An overpayment that creates a debt to the Organization on the part of the staff member will normally be recovered immediately by means of deductions from salaries, wages, and other emoluments payable under the UN Staff Regulations and UN Staff Rules.  However, the HR Specialist or the Resident Representative, as the case may be, may agree with the staff member who has received overpayments on:     Alternative means of repaying the amount due, such as payment by bank transfer, bank cheque or personal cheque from the staff member; or   Recovery in monthly instalments subject to the contract expiry date of the staff member; or  Other methods of recovery at the disposal of the Organization.  The agreement on the method of recovery of an overpayment must include a written undertaking that if the staff member separates from service prior to full reimbursement of the debt owed to the Organization, any outstanding balance shall be recovered in full against his/her final emoluments or those paid to him/her by another UN Common System Organization. Any balance that exceeds the final emoluments due to him/her must be paid immediately and in full prior to separation.  In the absence of an agreement with the staff member on the method of recovery, the Organization may choose to recover such debt using any method of recovery at its disposal.       Responsibility for Recovery    The HR Specialist or the Resident Representative, as the case may be, are responsible for ensuring that overpayments are recovered in full.  Where there is indication that the full amount is not likely to be recovered, the matter shall be escalated to the Director, OHR and to the UNDP Comptroller.  ",
    "recruitment-and-selection-framework-policy": " Recruitment and Selection Framework Policy  \t Scope and Applicability\t  The paramount consideration in the recruitment and selection of UNDP staff members shall be... “the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity”, as set forth in Article 101, paragraph 3, of the UN Charter and UN Staff Regulation 4.2.   The UNDP Recruitment and Selection policies are intended to provide UNDP country offices and headquarters hiring units with the principles governing recruitment and selection and specific guidance for filling vacant posts at the local and international levels in accordance with the Charter, the Staff Regulations and the Staff Rules.   Unless otherwise indicated, these policies apply to the recruitment and selection for UNDP posts leading to appointments under the Staff Rules, both local and international, up to and including ICS-13 (D-1/P-6). This is inclusive of General Service (G1-G7 category) and the National Professional (NOA-NOE) category. However, the recruitment and selection of staff members for ICS-14 (D-2/P-7) level posts are the exclusive prerogative of the Administrator and will be guided by the Senior Review Group and the principles of this policy to the extent possible.   Individuals who are recruited for service limited to another entity (UN agency, fund or programme), but who are administered by UNDP on behalf of such an entity, are selected in accordance with the policy and procedure agreed upon by that entity and UNDP.   Relevant Policies Governing Framework, Principles, Conditions and Authority  This section provides the overall framework for recruitment in UNDP.  It highlights the most relevant UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, describes the guiding principles behind all staff recruitment and selection activities and lays out the necessary conditions for selection of candidates for UNDP posts, including their qualifications, demonstrated competencies and performance; integrity; diversity; including geographic distribution and gender parity; residency; staff status (including whether or not a staff member has been approved by an Advisory Body); mandatory retirement age and other related matters.    Relevant Staff Regulations  This policy implements UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules including but not limited to:   Regulation 1.2 (c): Staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and to assignment by him or her to any of the activities and offices of the United Nations.  Regulation 4.1: As stated in Article 101 of the Charter, the power of appointment of staff members rests with the Secretary-General.   Regulation 4.2: The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer or promotion of the staff shall be the necessity for securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. Due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.  Regulation 4.3: In accordance with the principles of the Charter, selection of staff members shall be made without distinction as to race, sex or religion. So far as practicable, selection shall be made on a competitive basis.  Regulation 4.4: Subject to the provisions of Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter, and without prejudice to the recruitment of fresh talent at all levels, the fullest regard shall be had, in filling vacancies, to the requisite qualifications and experience of persons already in the service of the United Nations.   Recruitment and Selection Policies and Procedures for all UNDP Posts  UNDP has established a separate recruitment and selection policy and procedure for each    \tof the following types of appointments:   FTA: international professional (IP)  posts covered by Candidate Pools;  TA: international or local, all levels and locations   Guiding Principles   The recruitment and selection of staff members at UNDP will be guided by the following six principles:  Competition: Selection will follow a visible and fair competitive process for all vacancies, regardless of post, contractual modality or hiring unit.   Objectivity: Screening will be conducted with professional rigor, with candidates measured against clearly articulated criteria, job skills and competencies and corporate priorities;   Transparency: The recruitment and selection criteria and all phases of recruitment processes will be transparent to staff and candidates to the fullest extent possible;    Diversity: UNDP’s workforce will reflect diversity and will strive to include equal numbers of men and women, staff members representing as wide a geographic distribution as possible and individuals from under-represented groups, indigenous groups and persons with disabilities.  Non Discrimination: Subject to the principle of recruiting staff members on as wide a geographical basis as possible, UNDP will not discriminate in its recruitment and selection processes on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, family status or disability.   Accountability: Hiring managers will be held accountable both for their selection proposals and the manner in which they have followed the processes leading up to them.   Accountability  Hiring managers are responsible and accountable for their selection proposals and for the manner in which the recruitment and selection processes have been conducted. When they sign off the submission for the Compliance Review Bodies they certify that the selection process was conducted properly.  Management is accountable for the planning of human and financial resources necessary to meet the business unit goals, objectives and work plan.   Employment of disabled persons  It is UNDP's policy to offer equal employment opportunities to persons having a physical or mental impairment when they are qualified and when a reasonable prognosis does not suggest a significant change in the person's capabilities and skills in the near future. To that end, every effort is made to modify the functional requirements of positions and the physical facilities associated with them, when that will facilitate the employment of qualified disabled persons.  Priority Considerations  Corporate Priorities  All candidates must meet the defined requirements in the vacancy announcement.   Hiring managers must give due consideration to corporate priorities or promulgated decisions such as order of retention, gender, nationality or geographical representation, as described below, may also come into consideration in the selection among qualified candidates.   For accountability purposes, Hiring Managers must make a documented business case for any selection decision they take which deviates from corporate considerations. Such business cases will be submitted to the relevant compliance review body (CRB/CRP), as appropriate. For selections that do not require the involvement of the CRB/CRP, the documented business case will be kept with the recruitment records.    Full regard to UNDP Internal Candidates and Order of Retention in Cases of Abolition of Post or Reduction of Staff  UNDP Vacancy Announcements may be advertised internally and externally at the same time. Without prejudice to the recruitment of new talent, full regard shall be given to qualified internal candidates.   Pursuant to Staff Rule 13.1 (d) and Staff Rule 9.6 (e), if the appointments of staff are to be terminated as a result of the abolition of a post or the reduction of staff; and provided that due regard is given to relative competence, integrity and length of service, staff members shall be retained in the following order of preference:   Staff members holding a Permanent Appointment (PA); Staff members holding a Continuing Appointment (CA); Staff Members holding a Fixed Term Appointment (FTA); Staff members holding a Temporary Appointment (TA).  The order of retention granted to staff members holding permanent appointments means that those staff members affected by the abolition of their posts or the reduction of staff will be given priority consideration over external candidates.   This means that staff members holding permanent appointments shall be given priority consideration over other internal candidates if they are qualified, and subject to the availability of suitable posts in which their services can be effectively utilized.   The order of retention also applies to staff members holding permanent appointments who apply for positions upon completion of their tour of duty or return from an inter-agency movement that has been authorized by the Organization.    The order of retention granted to staff members holding a fixed-term appointment means that those staff members affected by the abolition of their posts or a reduction in staff numbers will be given priority consideration over external candidates, including TA holders.   Eligibility Considerations Integrity  Pursuant to the UNDP Legal Framework for Addressing Non-Compliance with UN Standards of Conduct, a staff member summarily dismissed or separated from the UN Common System for disciplinary reasons shall be banned from any future employment and contractual opportunities with UNDP. Furthermore, a staff member who has resigned from the UN Common System while under investigation or in the course of disciplinary action shall be banned from work with UNDP under any contractual modalities until he/she is fully cleared from the allegations of misconduct raised against him or her.  Family Relationships  Pursuant to Staff Rule 4.7 and UNDP’s Policy on Family Relationships and in order to avoid real or perceived family influence or conflicts of interest, a staff appointment or a non-staff contract in UNDP shall not be offered to a person who bears any of the following relationships to a UNDP staff member: father, mother, son, daughter, sister or brother. There is no exception to this rule.  The above provisions on family relationships apply to the recruitment of individuals at UNDP, irrespective of the type of contractual modalities applicable (TA, FTA, CA or PA appointments as well as Service Contracts (SC) and Individual Contracts (IC). Given their non-staff status and receipt of a volunteer living allowance, United Nations Volunteers (UNVs) are exempt from this prohibition.   For individuals who are recruited by UNDP on behalf of another organization or who are hired to work for another organization under a UNDP administered contract, UNDP will, prior to the recruitment, advise that organization of the existence of the family relationship with the individual employed by UNDP in the same duty station.  While it is generally not advisable for another organization to pursue the recruitment of a candidate who has a family relationship with an individual employed by UNDP in the same duty station, UNDP will honour a written request from the other organization to recruit on their behalf, and the accountability for this decision will reside with said organization.  Spouse: Pursuant to Staff Rule 4.7 (b) and (c) and recognizing the importance of supporting dual careers, the spouse or recognized partner of a staff member may be appointed to a position, in accordance with UNDP’s Policy on Family Relationships. Age Limitations  Candidates who have reached the mandatory age of separation (MAS) shall not be considered for vacant posts. If they are less than 12 months in age from the MAS, they may be considered only with the understanding that the appointment does not affect their mandatory separation date and is not a justification for a waiver to the MAS.    With due consideration to the circumstances under which an individual separated except upon retirement, from UNDP or the UN Common System (which must be verified through reference checks as stipulated in the UNDP Policy on Minimum Academic Qualifications and Work Experience (LINK) and without prejudice to paragraph 21 above on integrity, former UNDP staff members may be recruited, if agreed to by Director, OHR through re-employment or re-instatement depending on the period that has elapsed between the separation and the resumption of the new functions and the contractual modalities applicable (see Staff Rules 4.17 and 4.18). Furthermore, the re-hired staff member may be required to reimburse in-part or in-full any monies received for the separation pursuant to Staff Rules 4.17 and 4.18 and any agreed separation arrangement.  Staff members moving from a FTA to TA type of appointments are subject to break-in-service requirements.  Hiring managers must not shortlist candidates whose appointment would violate these requirements.  Please refer to the Break-in-Service Requirements (Annex IV in the Temporary Appointment Guidelines).    Recruitment of Government Personnel   Any candidate who is a government employee must disclose this relationship prior to recruitment.  As a general rule, candidates who are employed by a government or a government entity must resign from said employment upon acceptance of an appointment with UNDP.   Cases where candidates are employed by a Government, will be reviewed individually. Where secondment arrangements have been agreed to, the candidate must declare loyalty to the UN only and promise to discharge their functions and regulate their conduct so as to preserve the independence, impartiality and neutrality expected of UNDP staff members as international civil servants. The first period of secondment shall  not exceed two years and can be renewed for an additional period of up to two years upon approval of the Director, OHR.  All candidates will be required to complete a Conflict of Interest Form.   Nationality and Residency Requirements Nationality  In accordance with Staff Rule 4.3, the United Nations shall not recognize more than one nationality for each staff member. The applicant, whether external to UNDP or already a UNDP staff member, must disclose all the nationalities he or she has acquired, even if only one nationality is recognized by the UN Common System for the purpose of the Staff Regulations and Rules.  Residency Requirements  Depending on the duty station and category of post, certain specific residency requirements may be applicable before an offer of appointment is made. For non-United States citizens who have permanent resident status in the United States please refer to STAI/2000/19.  Nationality of General Service and National Officer Staff  In accordance with Staff Rule 4.7, posts in the General Service (GS) and National Officer (NO) categories are subject to local recruitment. GS posts shall be filled, as far as possible, by persons recruited within the country and residing within commuting distance of each office.   National Officers must be of the nationality of the country where the office concerned is located. In the case of dual nationality the UN will recognize the nationality of the country where the office is located.  Special provisions may be applicable for locally recruited GS staff in countries where non-nationals who are residents of the duty station have been accorded legal working status by the host government.   Vacancies for GS positions located in New York/Washington D.C. Headquarters are open to the following:  staff members currently serving in the United States holding a valid G4 visa on account of their employment in the US (excluding detail assignments) under a FTA/CA/PA in the UN system; US Citizen; US Permanent Residents; holder of a G4 visa that is a derivative of a G4 visa held by a staff member that is currently serving on a G4 visa on account of their employment under a FTA/CA/PA in the UN system;   Current UNDP GS staff serving outside of HQ must meet the eligibility criteria stated above prior to their application. Selected candidates to locally recruited positions are responsible for their own travel and/or relocation costs.  Special provisions may be established for locally recruited GS and NO staff where the UNDP programme operates outside of the host country.   Nationals Serving in their Home Countries on International Professional Posts  Bearing in mind the principle of diversity and geographical representation as one of the corporate considerations for selection decisions, the following provisions apply to nationals serving in their home countries on international professional posts.  Nationals of programme countries cannot be recruited or assigned to international professional posts in UNDP Country Offices in their home countries.  This prohibition neither extends to Regional Centres, Liaison Offices, Policy Centres, other Global Centers, nor to Headquarters duty stations. It also does not apply to the deployment of international staff on surge missions in their home countries.  Section 7.0 Eligibility for Internal Movements (except for lateral moves)  Expected duration of assignment   It is expected that an IP staff member will remain in their post and complete their duration of assignment in order to deliver on expected results as well as to further develop their competencies.  Frequent reassignments pose a financial burden on the Organization and cause disruption to mandate delivery. The duration of assignment is normally five years for H and A duty stations, four years for B duty stations, three years for C duty stations and two years for D and E duty stations.   A hiring unit may consider IP staff members after they have served in their post, for one year for D and E duty stations and two years for all other duty stations  To respond to UNDP operational needs or for compelling personal reasons the standard duration of assignment may be extended or shortened.   Eligibility for Posts at Higher Grades  Internal candidates are eligible to apply for any higher-level positions for which they meet the minimum academic and experience requirements.  The candidate must meet all the requirements of the position.     Recruitment and Selection Procedures Common Recruitment and Selection Standards for all Staff   All recruitment and selection of staff members in UNDP must follow a rigorous, transparent and fair process.  As the Organization applies a rank-in-post policy, each and every staff recruitment and selection must adhere and be fully accountable to the corporate standards described below and the procedures described in the relevant policies.  Moreover, all staff responsible for performing recruitment and selection actions are accountable to perform these functions according to the relevant UNDP recruitment and selection policies.   Each recruitment and selection must include three basic elements unless a competitive selection is considered not practicable as per Section 9 below:   Vacancy announcement of a budgeted and classified post;  Competitive, job-specific objective assessment of skills and competencies as well as a competitive assessment of corporate values and ethics; and A thorough verification of relevant qualifications and credentials, including thorough reference checks.    Recruitment and Selection Strategies and Techniques  In cases of Crisis and Surge deployments, Fast Track procedures may be activated impacting Recruitment procedures. Please review the Fast Track policies and procedures for further information.   Depending on the type of post and post requirements, the strategies, methodologies and techniques used to recruit and select the most suitable candidates for the position may vary. Hiring managers may consult OHR or the local HR Unit, as appropriate, when deciding on the most effective approach for filling the post.    Prior to commencement of the recruitment and selection process, the hiring manager, in consultation with the HR professional and taking into account corporate diversity requirements, shall document the strategies, methodologies or techniques to be used for assessing candidates, based on the requirements of the post.   In all recruitment and selection processes, one or more  assessment methods must be used, these can include, among others, panel interviews, desk reviews, technical assessments, roster-review, writing tests, work samples,  or language proficiency tests. A   thorough review of the candidate’s performance history is mandatory.  The Hiring Manager must determine the best assessment method(s) that will help determine the most suitable candidate(s) for the job. The Hiring Manager must document the assessment approach and rating methodology to be pursued before commencing the recruitment process. Selection decisions are based on considerations resulting from the different assessment methods, corporate considerations such as gender and diversity as well as the needed mix of skills within the hiring unit. In CRB and CRP submissions, hiring units must provide all relevant information pertaining to the strategies, methodologies or techniques to be used for assessing candidates.  Assessment documentation and reports are confidential documents and are not to be shared with the candidates.  Candidates who are assessed but not selected may request feedback from the hiring unit as to why they were not selected.  Vacant Posts  No selection process shall commence without an approved, budgeted, classified and available post [Please see Annex I]. The post must be supported by an up-to-date post description, which describes the functions, competencies, impact and requirements of the post, including academic qualifications, relevant work experience and language fluencies.  The selection process shall not commence unless the position to be filled is a vacant post. A “vacant post” is defined as a post or position approved for six months or longer that is without an incumbent or whose incumbent is expected to move in the current or following year, and for which no right of return (i.e. specific lien) has been granted to the staff member.  Reclassification of Posts   The Rank-in-Post policy and the Job Evaluation guidelines specify the circumstances under which an encumbered post must be reclassified and the subsequent requirements for re-advertisement and the competitive recruitment process to be followed.   Under the Rank-in-Post policy, any post reclassified to a higher or lower level must be advertised for competitive selection. In the event a revised job description contains new and significant changes in functions and/or a new set of functional or technical competencies and qualifications, such posts must be also advertised for competitive selection; even if there is no change in grade. For further guidance on the business process and procedures for job classification, please refer to the policy on .   Vacancy Announcement\n The Vacancy Announcement (VA) for the post must state all the competencies and other corporate requirements for the position, in conformity with the job description and corporate standards. It may also indicate qualifications that are desirable for the post. Only those qualifications (required or desirable) that are indicated in the job description may be specified in the VA for the post.   FTA post vacancies will normally be posted for a minimum of  one week.  Applications for the Post  All persons who apply for a vacant post, in addition to submitting an online application and uploaded resume, must complete a profile on UNDP’s recruitment website.   Only those qualifications specified in the VA may be considered in the review of candidates for the position.  Minimum Academic Requirements, the specific level of education that must be met by candidates for the post must be specified in the VA.  If the post allows for a lower degree with additional years of relevant experience, this must be specified in the VA.  Only candidates who fully meet the required qualifications for the position, as specified in the vacancy announcement, may be short-listed for the post. However, candidates who are within six months of the minimum relevant experience requirement may be considered in situations where a business case is made.  The business reason must be documented and on record for the file.   To ensure competitiveness, the shortlist must be comprised of at least two candidates.  At least one woman should be included on the short-list.  If no female candidate is included on the short-list, the Hiring Unit must document the efforts that have been made to identify qualified female candidates including re-advertisement. Hiring units must ensure that every application to a position is afforded due consideration, that internal candidates are given priority consideration, and that there is objective reason provided for including, or not including, candidates on long-lists and short-lists.  Such supporting documentation will be reviewed by the relevant CRB/CRPs, as required, Failure to provide objective reasons for not including long-listed candidates on a short-list is cause for a CRP/CRB submission to be returned to the hiring unit.  Composition of Interview and Desk review Panels  The panel must, at a minimum, comprise of 3 panel members. The panel must include the hiring manager or his/her designated representative, and two other members outside of the hiring unit. An HR Representative where available, may be invited to participate as an additional panel member. All panel members must be graded equal to or higher than the post under consideration and be knowledgeable of the subject matter and familiar with the requirements of the position. A HR Representative where available, may participate as an Ex-Officio to provide specialized advisory services if they are graded below the post under consideration.   Hiring units may request non-UNDP staff members to participate in panels (in particular, colleagues from other UN Common System organizations) if they are able to offer an objective and substantive perspective to the recruitment process.  Retirees from the UN common system may also participate as panel members. Any panel member with a conflict of interest pertaining to any interviewee should exclude themselves from the interviewing process.   Notwithstanding that programme delivery increasingly relies upon building a close partnership with governments, participation of national counterparts or government officials on UNDP interview panels is not allowed as either a Panel Member or Observer.   Panels should include both men and women and be geographically diverse as far as possible.   In the event that panel members fail to agree on which candidate(s) to recommend for the post concerned or/and on the ranking of endorsed candidates, in consultation with the hiring manager, the varying viewpoints will be reviewed by OHR, who will advise the hiring unit as to options for moving forward.  This may include re-advertising the post.  Verification of Candidate Information and Reference Checking  It is the responsibility of the hiring unit to ensure the proper and thorough verification of critical information, including academic qualifications, languages, nationality, prior UN employment, and detailed reference checks. The UNDP Personal History Form (P.11) or e-Recruit online application is mandatory for all recruitments and selections and relevant candidate information on these matters requires verification and, in particular, the candidate’s employment history for purposes of reference-checking.  Please see UNDP’s Policy on Academic Qualifications which spells out specific criteria for verifying academic qualifications and UNDP’s Policy on Minimum Academic requirements.  In addition to conducting the prescribed reference checks, the hiring unit or OHR may be required to conduct additional verifications such as mandated by resolution, bulletin, and administrative instruction or as recommended by the Ethics Office.   Given the importance of the verification process for the proper selection of a candidate, under no circumstances may a proposed initial appointment be submitted to the CRB/CRP, or an offer of appointment be extended or otherwise communicated to a candidate, without the hiring unit first having completed all reference checks and found them to be satisfactory.   Corporate Review Requirements  Pursuant to Staff Rule 4.15, to ensure compliance with recruitment and selection rules, policies and processes by hiring units, the Administrator has established UNDP Compliance Review Bodies (CR Bodies) as follows:   Compliance Review Board (CRB) at Headquarters which reviews:  Selections for initial appointments to UNDP international professional posts Selections of UNDP internal candidates for international professional posts involving a change in staff grade level  Selections of staff involving a change in category (e.g. from NO or GS to P)   Compliance Review Panels (CRP) at headquarters locations and in country offices, regional centres and other non-headquarters locations.  The CRP reviews:  Selections for National Officer posts and local and HQ General Services posts for initial appointments or involving promotions  No offer of FTA can be made without the review of the relevant CRB/CRP as appropriate.  If a candidate is not endorsed by the CRB or CRP, the post cannot be re-advertised as a Temporary Appointment.  Hiring managers are responsible for submitting proposed candidates in accordance with the CR Bodies TOR and Rules of Procedure.  The above does not include posts covered under the Candidate Pool policy. For more information please review the Rules and Procedures for the UNDP Compliance Review Panel (CRP).   Obligation of Confidentiality  Everyone who is involved in a selection process, in one capacity or another (e.g. long-listing, short-listing, interview panel, Compliance Review bodies, etc.) must engage in these corporate activities maintaining strict discretion and confidentiality. A selection process is not completed until all the different selection, review and clearance steps have been taken. It is therefore expected that no information be shared with the candidates until the final approval for the selection has been signed.  Other Selection Procedures  Other Selection Procedures for Vacant UNDP Posts  Staff Regulation 1.2 (c) provides that “[Staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and to assignment by him or her to any of the activities or offices of the United Nations. In exercising this authority the Secretary-General shall seek to ensure, having regard to the circumstances, that all necessary safety and security arrangements are made for staff carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to them.]”   UNDP staff members are expected to accept any assignment so directed by the Administrator or the Associate Administrator.  While a competitive selection process through advertisement of the vacancies, is the standard selection process within UNDP in accordance with Staff Regulation 4.3, there are few mechanisms where the selection process may differ from the standard process: (i) Candidate Pools (ii) lateral moves; (iii) Rosters (iv) placement of unassigned staff and (v) strategic placements  Lateral Moves (not applicable to Candidate Pool positions)  In accordance with Staff Regulation 1.2 (c), management may decide in the interest of the Organization to assign a UNDP staff member to another post in the same field of work with similar functions at the same level without competitive process.   The decision for a lateral move is at the discretion of management and only after consultation with the concerned staff member. While a staff member may express his/her interest in moving laterally to another position within UNDP, a lateral move is not an entitlement. The management decision to fill a post through competitive process instead of lateral move is discretionary.   Lateral moves without a competitive process may only apply to similar posts in the same field of work with similar functions as documented in the job descriptions of both posts (the post encumbered by the staff member and the post considered for lateral move), at the same level requiring the same or a similar set of competencies.  Lateral moves without a competitive process may take place either (i) as a result of the exchange of two incumbents of similar posts in the same field of work with similar functions at the same level; or (ii) when a post is newly created, vacated or about to be vacated and the incumbent of a similar post in the same field of work with similar functions at the same level is re-assigned to the vacated post: in such a case, the post vacated by the reassigned staff member is either advertised or abolished.  The manager must discuss the proposed re-assignment or exchange with the staff members concerned in order to seek their views. While the staff members are subject to their management’s authority to reassignment to any of the similar posts with similar functions at the same level in the office, they must be consulted prior to the lateral moves and, as far as possible, their consent for the lateral moves should be secured. However, the consent of the staff members concerned must be secured in writing when the lateral move entails a change in duty station.   Lateral moves to different duty stations but in the same country may be allowed for the General Service (GS) or National Officer (NO) category of staff in the interest of the Organization and with the consent of the staff members concerned. However, no lateral move for GS and NO staff is allowed when such moves entail a change of country.    In cases which would entail a relocation having financial consequences, the entitlements to be paid pursuant to the Staff Rules must be listed in the documentation securing the consent of the staff members concerned and the endorsement of the Bureau Director/Head of Office or the Associate Administrator as appropriate.  In cases of Change Management and Organizational restructuring, relocation to a different duty station, including across bureaus may be considered. Staff Members whose position did not materially change may be requested to relocate, based on discussion with head of office/manager and OHR, in the interest of the Organization, financial sustainability and business requirements.   The process leading to lateral moves must be fully documented. The job descriptions must be provided to support that the two posts have similar functions and are at the same level. Prior consultation with the staff members concerned and their written consent in the event that the lateral moves entails the change of duty stations, must be evidenced. A copy of the signed approval with the relevant documentation and clearance must be provided for implementation of the necessary action:  to OHR/BMS for P and D, as well as HQ GS staff members; to the HR focal point in the relevant business unit for other GS and NO staff members.   A staff member who has joined another post through a lateral move is expected to normally stay at least one year in that new position or two years if the position is in another duty station. A lateral move does not entitle the staff member to additional steps in the salary scales applicable to his/her grade.  The present section on lateral moves does not apply to staff on Temporary Appointments (TA), Individual Contractors and Service Contract holders.  Management should monitor and provide oversight for the correct and appropriate way of planning a lateral move and take the necessary action to prevent misuse such as to move a staff member due to bad performance.  The latter should be addressed through the PMD mechanism.   Management is also responsible for ensuring availability of funds before making a decision for lateral moves that entails a change in duty station.  The approving office will keep a record of any lateral move that has been approved for future reference.  Placement of Unassigned Staff or Staff in the Transition Pool   In order to facilitate the placement of unassigned staff, a Hiring Manager may select an unassigned staff member (or a staff member who may imminently become unassigned) to fill a vacant post without a competitive process if the staff member has been vetted by OHR/BMS and found to fully meet the required qualifications for the position. The decision to place an unassigned staff member is at the discretion of management and only after consultation with the concerned staff member. While an unassigned staff member may express his/her interest in being placed without a competitive process, such a placement is not an entitlement.   Strategic Placement  Strategic Placements are exceptional in nature and will be only considered when the requirements of the Organization are so urgent or the situation so critical or sensitive, that carrying out a competitive process to fill a specific post would not be practicable.  In such cases, the Administrator, or the Associate Administrator for posts at the D1 level and below, may decide to exceptionally fill the post outside of the present Framework and the recruitment and selection policies.   Before considering the possibility of a strategic placement, options such as the deployment of an unassigned staff member, implementation of a lateral move within the same business unit or employing Fast-Track Procedures must be thoroughly considered.  As far as possible, the post to be filled on an urgent basis should be given to a UNDP staff member meeting the requirements for the post and already at the level of the post. However:  (i)   in the event that the post is exceptionally filled by an outsider and since the selection will not be submitted to the relevant Compliance Review body prior because of the urgency, the letter of appointment will specify that his/her appointment is limited to the specific post in question and he/she will not be considered as an internal candidate for the purpose of UNDP vacancies; normally, the individual will be separated from UNDP upon expiry of his/her appointment limited to the post in question, unless he/she secures a UNDP through competitive process as an external candidate;  (ii) in the event that through strategic placement a UNDP staff member is exceptionally placed to a higher level post than his/her personal grade, he/she will be granted the level of the post on a temporary basis for the time he/she encumbers the specific post in question. When he/she leaves this post, he/she will not be eligible for applying for a higher level post until he/she has obtained, through proper competitive process, a lateral move at the level of the post to which he/she was strategically placed. This rule is meant to ensure that staff members do not benefit, through strategic placement, from a promotion to a higher level post without competition and without their selection having been reviewed by the relevant Compliance Review body, as required by the Rank-in-post policy.      A strategic placement may occur only once in a staff member’s career with UNDP.    Recruitment on Behalf of Other Entities   In instances when UNDP country offices are requested to recruit and administer staff on behalf of other UN Funds, Programmes and Agencies, such entities are to follow UNDP recruitment policies unless otherwise specifically negotiated.    Delegations of Authority   Appointment of UNDP Staff Members   The authority to appoint UNDP staff members under the Staff Rules has been delegated by the Secretary-General to the Administrator of UNDP.  The recruitment and selection process used to fill a vacant post at UNDP depends on several factors, including the nature of the post (rotational or non-rotational), the contractual modality and whether authority to make the appointment has been delegated from the Administrator to other members of senior management at UNDP headquarters locations and country offices.  The Administrator has further delegated the authority for the recruitment and selection of staff (subject to CRB/CRP approval where required) to the Associate Administrator, Bureaux Directors and Resident Representatives  according to the type of post as follows:  Associate Administrator:   Headquarters international posts subject to Executive Board review for posts included in the Candidate Pools. Senior management posts at the D-1 level irrespective of funding and key advisory positions at the P-6 level that are management project funded posts.  b)   Bureau Directors and Directors of Independent Offices: Headquarters international posts subject to Executive Board review (‘core’ functions) for posts not included in the Candidate Pools. Internationally recruited Fixed Term Appointments (FTA) P1 – P6 on posts not subject to Executive Board approval. Locally recruited FTA G1 – G7 at Headquarters. All internationally recruited and local Temporary Appointments (TA).  c)   Heads of Regional Centres, Policy Centres and Liaison Offices: The same as Bureaux Directors for posts within their Office.    d)   Resident Representatives: As above for Heads of Regional Centres for posts within their Country Office.  e)   Director Office of Human Resources, BMS and Director, Global Shared Services Center, BMS   The Director Office of Human Resources, BMS as the functional lead for human resources, is accountable to ensure that policies and processes align with the ICF, including monitoring compliance. The Director, Global Shared Services Center, BMS is accountable for the quality of the recruitment services provided by BMS/GSSC.  These delegated authorities requires that all recruitments and selections are made in accordance with the applicable UNDP recruitment policies and Staff Regulations and Rules.  Decisions on Lateral Moves\t  Decisions on Lateral moves have been delegated as outlined below:  a)  Administrator for staff at D-2/P-7 grade levels.\n Director, OHR with clearance from both receiving and releasing Bureau Directors and/or Directors of Independent Offices up to P-5 grade levels.  Associate Administrator for D-1/P-6 grade levels.  Regional or Central Bureaux Directors/ Resident Representatives/Head of Liaison Office for GS and NO staff members within their Office (with clearance of Director, OHR)   Decisions on Strategic Placements  Decisions on strategic placements remain within the authority of the Administrator and Associate Administrator as follows:  Administrator for D-2/P7 grade levels; Associate Administrator for all other post levels.  ",
    "relocation-shipment": "Relocation Shipment  Structure Element - Relevant Policies Staff members who travel on initial appointment, reassignment and repatriation are provided a relocation shipment entitlement in the form of a lump sum which is determined by the number of dependents authorized to travel with the staff member, if any. The lump sum is based on the staff member’s recognized status at the time of the relocation and is paid in advance of the relocation.   Staff receiving the relocation shipment lump sum are expected to make their own arrangements for shipment and manage their own relocations along with all the related expenses incurred by them during relocation including customs or insurance fees.  When the lump sum option is applied, no changes in the entitlement shall be recognized until the next relocation of the staff member. For example, if a staff member marries during his/her assignment, the organization will not provide additional monies to relocate the spouse in mid-assignment. However, upon the next official relocation, the dependent amount will be paid.   UNDP may on an exceptional basis, make shipping arrangements in lieu of the relocation shipment lump sum. The exceptional organization- assisted shipment is based on a 20 ft. and 40 ft. container for staff with and without dependents respectively. This does not apply to moves from one duty station to another within the same country.  The entitlement to unaccompanied shipment of personal effects is:   A staff member’s shipment is considered within the entitlement if the shipment or total of shipments is within the weight authorized.  The shipment entitlement is expressed in terms of net weight or net volume which includes packing but not the weight of crating and lift vans. \nRelocation Shipment for Full Removal of Personal Effects and Household Goods   Entitlement to full removal of personal effects and household goods may be granted in cases of: Appointment to a Headquarters duty station, when the staff member is not expected to be reassigned, for a continuous period which is expected to be two years or longer; and Separation of a staff member who had an appointment of two years or longer or has completed two years’ service at a Headquarters duty station, and an entitlement to full removal of personal effects and household goods was established at the time of initial appointment. Split shipment must be effected no later than one year from the date of separation.  The maximum weight and/or volume for which entitlement to removal at UNDP expense exists is: For a staff member without a spouse or dependent child, a 20-ft container (equivalent to 33.2 cubic metres), including the weight or volume of packing but excluding crating and lift vans; and For a staff member with a spouse or dependent child residing at the official duty station, a 40-ft container (equivalent to 67.7 cubic metres), including the weight or volume of packing but excluding crating and lift vans.  A staff member entitled to full removal costs may convert part of the entitlement into an advance shipment of personal effects, by the most economical means, up to a maximum, including the weight or volume of packing but excluding crating and lift vans, of: 450 kg (990 lbs.) or 2.80 cubic meters (99 cubic feet) for the staff member; 300 kg (660 lbs.) or 1.87 cubic meters (66 cubic feet) for the first eligible family member; and 150 kg (330 lbs.) or 0.93 cubic meters (33 cubic feet) for each additional eligible family member authorized to travel at UNDP expense.  For conversion to air freight, see provisions for split shipment above. The weight of an advance shipment will be deducted from the maximum weight or volume to which the staff member is entitled under removal of household goods.  Where both spouses are staff members of UNDP or another organization of the UN common system and each is entitled to full removal of household goods, the maximum weight or volume that may be removed at UNDP expense for both of them is that provided for a staff member with a spouse or dependent child(ren) residing at the official duty station.  \nStorage of Personal Effects and Household Goods \nStorage charges in cases of full removal of personal effects  When a staff member with a full removal entitlement is assigned to a non-family duty station; UNDP pays the costs of storage of personal effects and household goods and other pertinent charges, including the cost of insurance, subject to the conditions and up to the maximum provided for above.   The quantity of goods authorized for storage shall not exceed the difference between the staff member’s maximum shipment allowance and the amount actually shipped.  If storage is authorized, UNDP will pay the storage charges up to five years following the effective date of the staff member’s assignment. When the staff member’s assignment is extended beyond five years for a period of up to two years at the same duty station, UNDP will continue to pay storage charges for the period of such extension.  \nStorage charges in cases other than full removal  UNDP may pay storage costs at the previous duty station when a staff member completes his/her assignment at a duty station and departs from the duty station on home leave or temporary assignment and his/her next duty station is not yet determined. \nOther conditions related to storage charges  Storage charges are not paid in the case of mission or other assignments not involving a change of official duty station. Storage charges in respect of shipment of personal effects and household goods referred are not reimbursed unless they are directly incidental to the transportation of the consignment.Structure Element - Templates and Forms  Loss of entitlement to relocation shipment   A staff member who, upon separation from service, is not entitled to payment of return travel expenses for himself or herself, and their eligible family members if applicable, shall not be entitled to payment of relocation shipment.  Upon separation from service, entitlement to relocation shipment shall cease where payment of relocation shipment would result in a duplication of entitlements.    Upon separation from service, entitlement to relocation shipment shall cease if the shipment has not commenced within two years of the date of separation.  Where both spouses are staff members and the spouse who separates first is entitled relocation shipment, his or her entitlement shall not cease until two years after the date of separation of the other spouse.  A resignation after completing less than one (or two years of service for staff entitled to full removal relocation shipment), shall result in the loss of relocation shipment.  Normally, in cases where for reasons not attributable to UNDP, the staff member does not complete the period of service in respect of which UNDP has paid a relocation shipment or lump sum, these costs can be adjusted proportionately and recovery made. The Director, OHR may determine that there are compelling circumstances that do not warrant the loss or adjustment of the relocation shipment entitlement.  Templates and Forms  Relocation Grant Attestation         PT 78 (Itemized Valued Inventory of Personal Effects/ Insurance Claims Procedure)  Information on Exceptional shipment organized by UNDP   The normal costs of packing, crating and lift vans, cartage, unpacking and uncrating will be borne by the Organization.   The weight of crating and lift vans payable by the Organization will not exceed fifty per cent of the net weight of the shipment. Any excess weight of crating and lift vans will be added to the actual net weight.   Staff members and the UNDP officials involved with the organization arranged shipments must ensure that the packing company provides a Weight Certificate with the weight and volume figures in both net and gross terms.  If the packing company is absolutely unable to provide a net weight, this is determined on the basis of two-thirds of the gross net or volume of the shipment shown on the airway bill, bill of lading, or weight certificate. \nExample: If the gross weight is 900 kilograms, the calculated net weight would be 600 kilograms.  For air shipments, the actual weight is taken into account and not the chargeable weight, in determining whether the shipment is within the entitlement. \nExample: For a staff member whose entitlement is 500 kilograms by air, if the actual net weight is 400 kilograms but the chargeable weight is 650 kilograms, he/she would be considered to be within the entitlement.   Where both spouses are staff members and each is entitled to an unaccompanied shipment of personal effects, the maximum weight authorized for both staff members will be that which is applicable to a staff member with a spouse or an eligible dependent child residing at the official duty station.  \nAdvance Air Shipment - One-to-One Ten Percent Conversion   To allow staff members to receive the most essential items needed to set up a household immediately upon arrival at the destination, ten percent of the total surface entitlement may be converted to airfreight on a one-to-one basis without prior approval. The balance of the entitlement may be shipped by surface, or by air.  Example: Ten per cent of a 1,000 kilogram surface entitlement, or 100 kilograms, may be sent as an advance air shipment, leaving a balance of 900 kilograms by surface, or 450 kilograms by air (see the paragraph below).  One-half Conversion of Surface Shipment to Air Shipment  Where unaccompanied surface shipment is the most economical means of transport, the staff member may elect to convert to unaccompanied air shipment on the basis of one-half of the weight of the authorized surface entitlement. \nExample: An unaccompanied surface shipment entitlement of 1,000 kilograms may be converted to 500 kilograms unaccompanied air shipment.   Full Conversion of Surface Shipment to Air Shipment   Notwithstanding the one-half rule in the paragraph above, conversion to air freight on the basis of full weight may be exceptionally authorized in the following cases:  Where the cost of air freight is lower than surface shipment; Where there is an extraordinary risk of damage to or loss of the surface shipment in transit; and/or For landlocked countries, where carrier time between port of origin and final destination (including any trans-shipment time) will exceed ninety days.   A request for exceptional authorization for full conversion to air shipment must be addressed six weeks before the date of the staff member’s intended departure:  For staff stationed outside New York, to the local administering office; or For staff stationed in New York, to the UNDP Travel Services Section (TSS), General Operations/Office for Sourcing and Operations/Bureau for Management Services  The request must specify the reasons for seeking the exception and, as far as possible, accompanied by documentary evidence to prove that the exception is warranted. \nFull Conversion of Air Shipment to Surface Shipment   Unless the cost of air shipment is higher than surface shipment, a staff member may elect to convert from air to surface on the basis of one-to-one. \nExample: A full air entitlement of 1,000 kilograms may be converted to a surface shipment of 1,000 kilograms.  \nSplit Shipment   Staff members may be granted a split shipment subject to the following conditions: there is no additional cost to the organization over and above the actual entitlement; and  there are no more than two shipments.   A total of three shipments may be authorized only to include a ten per cent advance air shipment, if any. Only the total weight entitlement in kilograms may be split and not the total transportation value. \nExample: If a staff member has an entitlement of 1,000 kilograms by surface NY/Jakarta which would cost $8,000, he/she ships 700 kilograms from NY to Jakarta and 500 kilograms from Hong Kong to Jakarta, (combined weight is 1,200 kilograms), the staff member will be charged for the over-entitlement of 200 kilograms on the Jakarta/Hong Kong shipment, even though the total cost of both shipments is $7,500.   The shipment may be split between air and surface and/or between points of departure and destination. \nExample: A surface entitlement of 1,800 kilograms may be split in different ways such as: a 10% advance air shipment of 180 kilograms NY/Dakar, 1,000 kilograms by sea NY/Dakar, and the balance of 620 kilograms by surface converted to one-half, or 310 kilograms by air, Copenhagen/Dakar.  Requests for split shipment must be addressed for approval, at least four weeks before the date of the staff member’s intended departure: For staff stationed outside New York, to the local administering office; or For staff stationed in New York, to the UNDP Travel Services Section (TSS), General Operations/Office for Sourcing and Operations/Bureau for Management Services  The split shipment must be effected within two months of arrival at the duty station or receipt of the split shipment authorization.  \nConversion of Unaccompanied Shipment to Excess Accompanied Baggage   Staff members may elect to convert part or all of their unaccompanied shipment entitlement to accompanied excess baggage on the basis of five-to-one.  \nExample: 100 kilograms of unaccompanied air or surface shipment entitlement would be converted to 20 kilograms accompanied excess baggage.  \nConversion of Excess Accompanied Baggage to Unaccompanied Shipment   Staff members may elect to convert their excess accompanied baggage entitlement to unaccompanied shipment, on a one-to-one basis, whether by air or surface means of transportation.  \nExample: 25 kilograms of accompanied excess baggage entitlement will be converted to 25 kilograms of unaccompanied air or surface shipment.  The conversion of excess accompanied baggage to unaccompanied shipment shall not apply when the accompanied baggage allowance for any portion of the journey is calculated by airlines on the basis of pieces and size of baggage. \nLoss of Entitlement   The unaccompanied shipment entitlement will be forfeited if not utilized, For initial appointment, reassignment and separation, within one year of the travel to or from the duty station; and For separation from service, within two years from date of separation  Exclusion of Entitlement   Except for customs clearance and delivery to residence, the organization will not pay certain expenses incurred in connection with unaccompanied shipments of personal effects, such as: Transportation of items not normally required for personal use, e.g. animals, boats, motorcycles, trailers or other power-assisted conveyances, and flammable and hazardous materials. These items may not be included in a shipment arranged by UNDP, but may be shipped separately at the staff member’s expense if government regulations permit. (Staff members are responsible for checking into customs restrictions at the destination); Servicing of appliances, dismantling or installing of fixtures;  Special packing;  Demurrage (i.e. penalty charge for delayed pick-up of a shipment from seaport or airport beyond the free time allowed); Storage (except where storage is exceptionally authorized); Delivery from storage warehouse to residence (except where storage is exceptionally authorized); and Import and export duties.  Shipping Arrangements  The responsibilities of the staff member and UNDP in  arranging the shipment and the procedures for arranging shipments are described in detail in the “Procedures” section.  Other shipping arrangements outside of those listed and approved in the UNDP Programme and Operations Policies and Procedures (POPP) will be reviewed by the Director, Global Shared Service Unit (GSSU) or their delegate and exceptionally approved based on the circumstances described.  Timing   The staff member should obtain the travel authorization at least three (3) months before the intended date of shipment.  A minimum of three (3) week’s lead time from receipt of the shipment authorization is needed to facilitate shipping, actual shipping time frame will vary based on the point of origin and destination Once the travel authorization is issued, the staff member will be contacted by UNDP’s contracted moving company's surveyor within three (3) business days to:  make an appointment to survey the goods to be shipped,  schedule the dates for packing and  book the shipment.  No guarantee can be made as to the arrival time of the shipment at the final place of delivery.  The staff member should be at the destination prior to the arrival of the shipment to produce certain official documents required for import customs clearance (such as, but not limited to, a certificate of residence issued by the municipal authorities) and to attend the delivery of the shipment to his/her residence.   Estimates for Weight   Estimates are not binding for the forwarding company or for UNDP and only serve as a guide for the staff member to plan the best use of his/her shipping entitlement.   Notwithstanding the second paragraph under “Responsibilities of UNDP Country Office at Point of Origin” below, a difference of no more than 15% between the estimate and the actual figures is considered reasonable, provided there has been no change in the original list of items included in the estimate.   Excess Shipment – Calculation and Settlement of Over-Entitlements   If the shipment exceeds the authorized maximum weight allowed, the charges to be paid by the staff member will need to be settled directly with the shipping company.   Customs Clearance at Destination   Staff members who are making shipments to the New York tri-state area are required to go through the UN Travel and Transportation Section (UNTTS) as registration of these shipments is required by the U.S. State Department.   UNDP COs and other BUs outside of HQs will continue to assist staff, at the receiving end, with any shipment that they choose to make. All costs however will be paid by the staff member concerned.  \nIn-Transit Insurance of Personal Effects and Household Goods  The maximum insurance entitlement for unaccompanied shipments of staff serving on a fixed term appointment of one year or longer shall be $1,600.  The maximum entitlement for unaccompanied shipments of staff members on a fixed term contract assigned for one year or longer shall be: $16,000 for the individual staff member; $8,000 for the first eligible family member; and $4,800 for each additional eligible family member.  For removal shipments under UN Staff Rule 7.16, inclusive of any advance shipment, the maximum insurance coverage shall be: $80,000 for a staff member without a spouse or dependent child; or b) $130,000 for a staff member with a spouse or dependent child.  The UN arranges for in-transit insurance coverage which ends upon arrival of the shipment at destination (i.e. staff member’s residence or a storage warehouse).   A staff member can elect to have the organization arrange for insurance against all risks of physical loss or damage from external cause on unaccompanied shipments authorized to be shipped and insured at UNDP expense.   If the staff member does not request an insurance coverage for the total of the value shown on the inventory, the insurance company’s liability is reduced and any resulting insurance claim will be settled on a reduced pro-rata basis. For example, if an unaccompanied shipment valued at $50,000 is insurance for only $25,000, the staff member will not receive more than 50 per cent of the value listed in the inventory for any goods lost or damaged.  Staff members who are subject to national income taxation in respect of their UN salaries are required to have additional insurance coverage for the difference between the full value and the coverage provided above by the organization for their personal effects and household goods while in transit or storage.   The above insurance entitlements do not apply to shipments arranged by staff members who have opted for the Relocation Grant.  \nExtension of Insurance Coverage  If a staff member is unable to take possession of his/her belongings upon their arrival at seaport/airport and the goods are stored, he/she should request an extension of insurance at his/her own expense from the company which insured the shipment so that the goods would be protected in the event of an insurance claim.   The insurance entitlement shall not include articles of special value for which special premium rates are charged. In such cases the cost above the normal premium for insuring standard items is payable by the staff member even if he/she is within the overall insurance entitlement.  Insurance Claims   If a staff member has arranged insurance coverage for his/her unaccompanied shipment of personal effects and household goods through the UNTTS, he/she may file a claim through them in case of loss/damage to all or part of the shipment.  \n  ",
    "rental-subsidy": "Rental Subsidy and Deductions   The purpose of the rental subsidy scheme is to facilitate the settlement of new staff members and to encourage mobility within the UN Common System. It subsidizes the rental costs of eligible staff members whose rental accommodations are of a reasonable standard but cost significantly more than the average for the duty station.    There are two different types of rental subsidy: one for staff members serving in Europe and North America and another for staff members serving outside Europe and North America.     Eligibility    Internationally recruited Staff Members who are in the Professional category and above (including Temporary Appointments) governed under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules and who are in receipt of post adjustment.    No rental subsidy shall be paid to staff who live in their own homes or who do not pay rent for their dwellings.    Period of Entitlement    Staff members can apply for rental subsidy from the first day of the signed lease agreement following the end of the period during which the staff member was paid the daily subsistence allowance element of the assignment grant received on arrival at the duty station. For staff recruited at the duty station who did not receive an assignment grant on appointment, rental subsidy is payable from the date of initial arrival at the duty station and from the date of the signed lease agreement.    Staff members assigned to duty stations in Europe and North America can receive rental subsidy for a maximum of seven years from the date of initial arrival at the duty station. In cases of force majeure, rental subsidy can be paid for a maximum of five years counted from the first day of the new lease after the occurrence of the force majeure.     When the rental subsidy is payable for part of a month, it shall be prorated in the proportion that the partial month bears to the full calendar month.    Rental subsidy is normally payable in United States dollars. Should a staff member request payment of the rental subsidy in another currency, it shall be subject to exceptional approval and shall be payable in accordance with the UN Operational Rate of Exchange prevailing on the date the payment is made. Any fees associated with the payment of subsidy in another currency are the responsibility of the staff member.    Rent Paid by the Staff Member     Rent paid by the staff member is the recurring amount specified in the lease agreement, which the staff member agrees to pay for the right to live in the rented accommodation.   This amount does not include other additional recurring expenses.  Items that are linked to utilities, consumption, maintenance, finishing, services, fixtures are excluded. Tax on rent may be included if the HR Specialist concludes that the tax is part of the normal rent of space.  Individual Threshold    The individual threshold amount is established by applying the rental subsidy threshold percentage for a duty station to the staff member's income. The rental subsidy threshold percentage is determined together with the post adjustment rates for a duty station by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC). The threshold amount is determined at either single rate or dependency rate.    The staff member is entitled to rental subsidy if the rent exceeds the individual threshold of the staff member. Staff members are expected to bear the rent up to the threshold amount without subsidy.    Reasonable Maximum Rent Level    The reasonable maximum rent level for duty stations in Europe and North America are established by the Secretary-General.   At duty stations outside Europe and North America, the reasonable maximum rent level referred to in paragraph 13 shall be established, based on the determination by the authorized official at the duty station as to whether, given the local market conditions, the rental payments are reasonable or substantially higher than rents for dwellings of similar quality and size. Such determination must be certified by the authorized official, in accordance with the criteria set out in the Annex to this policy and shared with the HR Specialist in Copenhagen, that serves the duty station.  When it is determined that the rental payments are substantially higher than rents for dwellings of similar quality and size at the duty station, the amount of the subsidy shall be calculated on the basis of the highest of the rents paid by staff members with similar family circumstances for dwellings certified as reasonable at the duty station.  In duty stations outside Europe and North America where the United Nations Country Team has established maximum reasonable rental levels, those levels should be used in the rental subsidy application.  The Country Office should also inform the HR Specialist in Copenhagen, that serves the duty station, of the UNCT decision and share with him/her the established matrix of reasonable rental levels.   Reimbursement Rate     The reimbursement rate for the rental subsidy at duty stations outside Europe and North America is 80 percent of that portion of the rent paid by the staff member that exceeds the individual rental subsidy threshold, provided that the rent paid by the staff member does not exceed the reasonable maximum rent level.   The reimbursement rate for duty stations in Europe and North America is determined based on the following table:      When electricity charges are included in the rent, the following amounts, or equivalent in local currency, shall be deducted from the total monthly rent payable to determine the amount of rent to be used for purposes of determining the rental subsidy: studio or one-bedroom dwelling, $30; two-bedroom dwelling, $40; three-bedroom dwelling, $50; four-bedroom dwelling, $60; and dwelling with five or more bedrooms, $70.  Maximum and Minimum Amounts of Rental Subsidy    The maximum amount of rental subsidy is 40 percent of the rent paid by the staff member or the applicable reasonable maximum rent level, whichever is lower. However, for specific duty stations outside Europe and North America, ICSC has waived that ceiling or  established a higher ceiling. These countries are referred to as W40.  If the payable monthly rental subsidy amount is equal to or lower than US$10 or the equivalent amount in local currency, no rental subsidy shall be paid. No rental subsidy in excess of the determined reasonable maximum rent level shall be payable for the amount of rent paid by the staff member.   Mission Detail and Temporary Assignments   Staff members who travel on mission detail or temporary assignment to another duty station shall continue to receive the post adjustment at their parent duty station, including rental subsidy, provided that all applicable conditions are met. In such cases, the rental subsidy shall not be payable in respect of rented accommodation at the mission area duty station or at the duty station where the staff member is on temporary assignment.    Both Spouses are UN Staff Members     If both spouses are eligible for the payment of a rental subsidy at different duty stations, the rental subsidy shall be payable to each on the basis of his or her respective income. If both spouses are eligible for the payment of a rental subsidy at the same duty station, only one subsidy shall be paid. It shall be computed on the basis of the higher of the two incomes. If only one of the spouses is eligible for the payment of a rental subsidy, only the income of the eligible staff member shall be used for computation purposes.    Agent's Fee Subsidy   A subsidy may be paid to eligible staff members in respect of a one-time payment fee paid to a licensed real estate agent/broker for services rendered in obtaining accommodation at the duty station. The subsidy towards paid agency fee is payable when the amount of rent paid by the staff member does not exceed the amount of reasonable maximum rent level. If the amount of rent paid by the staff member exceeds the amount of reasonable maximum rent level, the agent’s fee shall be reduced in the proportion that the reasonable maximum rent level bears to the amount of the rent paid by the staff member.     The subsidy for an agent’s fee shall be calculated by applying the reimbursement rate to that part of the fee (or reduced fee) that exceeds the defined monthly individual threshold amount.    Combined Rent    In cases where eligible staff members are assigned to a duty station outside the capital city of the country of assignment, their rental expenses at the duty station, if any, and the rental paid for the family’s accommodation at another location in the country of assignment may be considered as a single rent for the purposes of the rental subsidy, subject to the conditions detailed in the administrative instruction.    Sublets   Rental of subleased housing may give rise to an entitlement to a rental subsidy if the sublet is legal and the staff member provides appropriate documentation. This normally requires the prior written consent of the landlord or the appropriate legal entity.     Rental Deductions   Staff members who receive housing assistance, including housing provided by the Organization, a government or a related institution, either free of charge or at rents substantially lower than the average rent used in calculating the post adjustment index for the duty station, shall normally be subject to payroll deductions from their salaries.    For rental deduction purposes, staff members shall be required to report and certify that they receive housing assistance or free accommodation provided by the  Organization, a government or a related institution at the time of taking up the dwelling. Staff members are obligated to inform the Organization of any changes in their housing situation that may affect their status or entitlements.   In accordance with the Staff Rule 3.18 (iv), deductions from salaries and other emoluments may be made  if dwellings are provided by the Organization, a government or a related institution. If the dwellings are clearly below standard, the amount of rental deduction may be reduced to one half of the normal rental deduction or exceptionally waived. The determination that the dwellings are below standard is based on the recommendation of the authorized official at the duty station.    Changes in Factors Used for Computation of a Rental Subsidy   When there is a change in any of the factors used in computing the rental subsidy that are accounted for automatically, such as changes in a staff member’s income, the threshold percentage, the reasonable maximum rent level, and/or the reimbursement rate, then the resulting change in the amount of rental subsidy will be effective from the date of the change in the respective factor.    When there is a change in other factors such as lease conditions, payable rent, and/or family status, then the effective date of the resulting change in amount of rental subsidy is the date the change of the respective factor took effect.    Relationship with Other Elements of the System of Salaries, Allowances, and Other Benefits   Rental subsidies and deductions have no effect on other elements of the system of salaries, allowances, and grants. The rental subsidy is non-pensionable and is not taken into account in determining separation payments. A staff member’s income for the purpose of determining insurance premiums and subsidies shall not be considered as affected by rental subsidies or deductions.                Annex   Certification criteria for purposes of determining the reasonable maximum rent level at duty stations outside Europe and North America   For the purpose of certification, at each duty station dwellings are grouped in three categories, as follows: A.\tReasonable  If a dwelling occupied by a staff member is similar in quality and size by reference to those occupied by other staff members at the same duty station having similar family circumstances and if the rental follows a general pattern of rents for dwellings of similar quality and size, then the dwelling in question should be certified as “reasonable”. It must be noted, however, that if a staff member has no alternative but to occupy a dwelling that is larger or better in quality in relation to those occupied by other staff members with similar family circumstances or if the rent is very high in comparison to other dwellings of similar size because of unavailability of other suitable accommodations, then the dwelling must still be certified as “reasonable”. B.\tAbove average  If a staff member occupies a dwelling that is substantially larger or better in quality in relation to those occupied by other staff members with similar family circumstances, resulting in higher rental payments, then the dwelling should be certified as “above average”. In this case, the highest rent paid by a staff member from among those with similar family circumstances and living in dwellings certified as “reasonable” must be used for the calculation of rental subsidies. C.\tSubstandard  Dwellings provided either free of charge or at a nominal cost which are of poor quality fall within this category. Dwellings of this type lack the minimum acceptable standard of construction and/or one or more of the basic amenities. It should be noted that the category “substandard” applies also to dwellings in capital or other major cities. ",
    "repatriation-grant": " Repatriation Grant   This policy takes effect on 1 July 2016 to reflect the introduction of a five-year qualifying period for the repatriation grant.  A repatriation grant is paid to internationally recruited staff members upon separation from service as compensation for being stationed away from the home country at the Organization's initiative for a period exceeding 5 years, in order to contribute to the extraordinary one-time expense of relocation and reinstallation. Eligibility   The repatriation grant is payable to internationally recruited staff members governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules who belong to both of the following groups:   Those whom UNDP has an obligation to repatriate following completion of a minimum of five years of qualifying service as defined in paragraph “Qualifying Service” below; and   Those who reside outside the home country and country of nationality while serving at the last duty station.  No repatriation grant is paid to:   A staff member who has not completed a minimum of five years of qualifying service as defined in paragraph “Qualifying Service” below  A staff member who abandons his/her post  A staff member who is dismissed   A locally recruited staff member under UN Staff Rule 4.4  A staff member who, at the time of separation, is residing in the home country  A staff member who has permanent residence status in the country of the duty station at the time of separation   A staff member otherwise entitled who does not submit a claim for payment of the grant within two years of separation on account of continued employment with another UN organization, in which case the claim must be submitted within two years of the effective end date of that employment with UNDP. Service Credits The amount of the repatriation grant is determined by the length of continuous service away from home country through the accrual of service credits for each qualifying year, beginning at the fifth year and as determined below. The maximum amount is payable after 12 years or more service credits. Qualifying service   Qualifying service for purposes of the repatriation grant upon separation from service is defined as follows:   When a staff member serves a minimum of five years of continuous service and residence away from the home country and the country of nationality or from a country where the staff member has acquired permanent resident status  During periods of special leave, qualifying service remains continuous. However, service credits for purposes of computation of the repatriation grant shall not accrue during periods of special leave with partial pay (SLWPP) or without pay (SLWOP) of one full month or longer. Periods of less than 30 calendar days do not affect the ordinary rate of accrual of service time for the repatriation grant.  Service is considered to be broken by separation from service as defined in UN Staff Rule 9.1. If re-employed under UN Staff Rule 4.17, a new period of qualifying service will begin upon the staff member’s re-employment.  Continuous service is not interrupted by assignment to the home country or country of nationality or country of permanent residence; however, in such cases qualifying service credits towards the repatriation grant shall be counted as follows:   The qualifying service credits are reduced by twice the number of completed years and months of non-qualifying service within the home country, or the country of nationality, or country of permanent residence  Following reassignment to a duty station outside the home country or the country of nationality or country of permanent residence, qualifying service credits towards the repatriation grant shall be restored at twice the normal rate until such time as the service credits reduced in paragraph i) above have been restored. Thereafter, qualifying service credits shall accrue at the normal rate until the maximum of 12 years is reached; and   Upon separation, the staff member is entitled to payment of the grant on the basis of the balance of qualifying service at that time;   Qualifying service credits for staff members that have been exceptionally authorized to acquire or maintain permanent resident status in the country of their duty station and subsequently change that status shall begin to accrue from the time such change was made, provided that all other requirements are satisfied.  Both spouses are UN staff members   If both spouses are employed by the UN and the spouse who separates first is entitled to repatriation grant, his/her entitlement to repatriation grant shall cease if no claim for payment of the grant has been submitted within two years after the date of separation of the other spouse.  Change of category from international to local   International staff members returning to their home country as local staff members are entitled to payment of the repatriation grant. If subsequently they are reappointed as international staff members, a new period of qualifying service will begin.    Note, however, that upon return to their home country as local staff members, these staff members are not entitled to payment of the Settling-In Grant.   Death of staff member  If a staff member dies, payment of a repatriation grant will be made only if there is a surviving spouse or one or more dependent children whom UNDP is obligated to return to the home country.  Loss of entitlement   Except when both spouses are UN staff members, a staff member’s eligibility for payment of the repatriation grant is forfeited when it is not claimed and evidence of relocation is not produced within two years of separation from UN service (see paragraph regarding claims below).   A staff member's eligibility for payment of the repatriation grant is not affected by the loss of entitlement to payment of return travel expenses.   Claim and evidence of relocation  Claim   Payment of the repatriation grant must be claimed and evidence of relocation produced by the former staff member within two years of the effective date of separation, after which time the entitlement shall lapse. A staff member, who upon separation from UNDP is employed in the UN Common System but otherwise not entitled to a repatriation grant may claim the grant and provide evidence of relocation within two years of the effective end date of such employment.  Evidence of relocation    The repatriation grant will be paid only to a former staff member upon presentation of documentary evidence that he/she has established residence which is not temporary in nature in a country other than the country of his/her last duty station.   Valid documentary evidence may be a Proof of Country of Residence Form duly completed/signed by or a declaration by:   The immigration, police, tax, municipal or other authority in the country of relocation;  The senior UN official in the country; or   By the former staff member's new employer  Such evidence must be submitted to the HR focal point in OHR Copenhagen serving the last duty station or organizational unit.  Payment  The modalities for the payment of the repatriation grant are as follows: Calculation   The amount of the grant is established in relation to the staff member's length of service with UNDP or another organization of the UN common system. It is calculated for international professional staff members, based on their gross salary, less staff assessment.   Rate   The repatriation grant is calculated at the rates specified according to the schedule provided in Annex IV of the Staff Regulations.  The repatriation grant is paid at the rate for a staff member with a spouse or dependent child, if the staff member, at the time of separation, has a spouse (regardless of whether the spouse is a dependent) or a child recognized as dependent, regardless of where they are located.   Both spouses are UN staff members  If both spouses are staff members and both are entitled to the repatriation grant, on separation, the grant is normally paid to each according to his/her length of qualifying service at the rate for a staff member with neither a spouse nor a dependent child at the time of separation. If there are dependent children, the first parent to be separated may claim payment of the grant at the rate for a staff member with a spouse or dependent child. In this case, the second parent to be separated may claim the repatriation grant either at the rate for a staff member with neither a spouse nor a dependent child at the time of separation for the period of service subsequent to the separation of the spouse or, if he/she is eligible, at the rate for a staff member with a spouse or dependent child for the whole period of qualifying service, less the amount of the repatriation grant paid to the first parent.  Death of staff member  Payment is made at the rate for a staff member with neither a spouse nor a dependent child at the time of separation if there is one such survivor and at the rate applicable to a staff member with a spouse or dependent child if there are two or more such survivors. The same requirements for documentary evidence for surviving dependents of relocation as outlined in the paragraphs under “Evidence of Relocation” apply.  Currency of payment  Payment of the repatriation grant is made in US dollars.  Transitional measure  A staff member with less than five years of qualifying service who was eligible for a repatriation grant under UN Staff Rule 3.19 in effect on 30 June 2016, shall be paid a repatriation grant in accordance with the schedule set out in Annex IV to the Staff Regulations in effect on 30 June 2016 for the number of years of qualifying service accrued as of 30 June 2016, and in accordance with Annex IV of the Staff Regulations in effect on 1 July 2016 thereafter.

    "retroactivity-payments": "Retroactivity of Payments    A staff member who has not received an allowance, grant, or other payment to which he/she is entitled, does not receive it retroactively unless a written claim has been made within one year following the date on which the staff member would have been entitled to such payment. If the error occurs in the payroll system, this will be corrected as soon as it is detected.     Submissions should be sent to:     If internationally recruited staff member stationed outside New York, the OHR Copenhagen HR Specialist serving the duty station    If locally recruited staff member stationed outside New York, the HR/Operations Manager    If internationally or locally recruited staff member stationed in New York, the OHR Copenhagen HR Specialist serving the organizational unit    Under unusual circumstances, consideration will be given to deserving requests for exceptions to the one-year limit on claims to entitlements. Such requests will be dealt with on an individual basis and judged on the merits of each case. Staff members should not expect exceptions to be approved when there have been unjustifiably long delays on the part of the staff member or when the case occurred long in the past.     Requests for exceptions should be addressed to:     If internationally recruited staff member stationed outside New York, the OHR Copenhagen HR Specialist serving the duty station    If locally recruited staff member stationed outside New York, the Resident Representative    If internationally or locally recruited staff member stationed in New York, the OHR Copenhagen HR Specialist serving the organizational unit    Appropriate justification should accompany each request including, whenever possible, documentary evidence justifying the delays.

    "rules-and-procedures-undp-compliance-review-panel-crp": "Compliance Review Bodies Annex I Rules and Procedures for the UNDP Compliance Review Panel (CRP) Competence and Terms of Reference   In Headquarters at New York, country offices, regional centers and non New York Headquarter locations where quorum criteria defined below can be met, a Compliance Review Panel (CRP) for UNDP locally recruited staff serving under UNDP Letters of Appointment is established by the Administrator or the head of office on behalf of the Administrator, under the provisions of Staff Rule 4.15 for the purpose of making recommendations in respect of:        UNDP Fixed Term (FTA) and Permanent Appointments (PA) against locally recruited posts GS1 – 7 and NOA – D.  All initial appointments to UNDP FTA local posts (GS1 – GS7 and NOA – NOD): this applies when the candidates selected are recruited from outside UNDP or were previously hired by UNDP under another contractual modality; or are current holders of Fixed Term Appointments without prior clearance of an APP.   Selection of a UNDP locally recruited staff member to a post one or more grade level(s) above their current grade or, exceptionally, to posts one grade below their current grade Selection of a UNDP locally recruited staff member to a post in a different category (higher or lower e.g. GS to NO or NO to GS)  Review of job classification and reclassification submissions prior to their approval by the Resident Representative (Please see job classification POPP for procedures)   Selection of staff from other agencies at the duty station even when it is to positions of the same grade level.  In non-New York Headquarter offices where the quorum criteria cannot be met, the head of office is required to make alternative arrangements with the CRP in New York for the review of their cases.  Country Offices that cannot meet the quorum requirements may utilize the New York CRP.  Additionally, when adequate capacity in terms of staffing, logistics, policy awareness and proper delegations of authority have been established in a Regional Centre, their CRP may be utilized in lieu of New York.  Regional Centres who meet the criteria and will be designated by the Director OHR as able to perform this function.  The CRP may also review the recommended selections for recruitment of locally recruited staff at levels GS1 – 7 and NOA – NOD of other UN organizations at the duty station for which such authority and arrangements have been established.  The CRP does not review:  Temporary Appointments  Selections of staff to posts at the same grade level  Composition, Procedure and Quorum  A quorum for any CRP to conduct business is four staff members.  Exceptionally, three members may constitute a quorum when the Chair is available and the secretary has confirmed that other members are not available due to leave.  High workloads, even in peak periods, are not a sufficient justification for reducing the quorum to three.  Alternates are no longer appointed so the total membership should be broadened to at least eight.    The total membership in New York will be up to twenty.  Membership should consist of both staff from both the National Officer and General Service categories.  The CRP at Headquarters in NY consists of staff from the GS and P categories in roughly equal numbers.      Composition of any specific CRP should consider recommendations for selections to those posts equal to the level of the lowest graded member of that CRP.  In other words, no member will attend meetings or portions of meetings where staff or posts higher than their grade level are being reviewed.  For national officer selections where quorum composition requirements are difficult, the Resident Representative, in consultation with the local staff association, may do the following:  Include eligible staff from other UN agencies at the commensurate grade level  Temporarily use internationally recruited staff on FTA or PA.  Where there is adequate capacity, CR Panels at one location may also be requested to review and endorse selection processes on behalf of country offices or regional centers where local bodies may not have been set up at the time of selection.  The rule that the ex officio Secretary of the Panel does not vote may be waived to facilitate constituting a quorum.  In both HQ and country office locations, when half or more of the appointed members are on leave (mission travel, Sick Leave, Annual Leave, Home Leave etc) or are otherwise unable to perform their functions as CRP members, a special emergency quorum of three members may be called provided that there is one voting Chair and two voting members.  In no cases may the ex officio vote or be counted toward a quorum.  This arrangement is confirmed by the CRP Secretary and head of office or Director of OHR in NY.   If it is still not possible to meet the quorum requirement then the Resident Representative may take other viable arrangements, in consultation with the local staff association, including working with and through the UNDP Regional Centre CRP.  Appointment to CRP  In country offices, the Resident Representative is responsible for appointing CRP members.  Local staff associations, where they exist, should nominate staff for appointment.  These nominations should meet the criteria set forth below.  The total number of nominations by the staff representatives should not exceed half of the number of total membership of the CRP.  Additionally, staff representatives and management are encouraged to work together on the membership and when possible jointly name some of the members. When a local staff association is not available, either a meeting of all staff shall be convened or all staff may be invited to submit names for the Resident Representative’s consideration.    In other locations that have CRPs, including New York, it is the same process whereby the local Staff Association nominates fifty percent of the membership and the head of office appoints members.  In New York the Associate Administrator appoints CRP members.  All staff who serve on a CRP do so in their capacity as staff member (those staff holding a FTA or PA), not as either management or staff representatives.    Only active staff members may serve on CRPs.  The work of CRPs is strictly confidential and must protect the rights of the individual staff and candidates being considered as well as the independence of the CRP membership and the integrity of their decisions.  As such, government officials and non UN staff may not under any circumstances be members or observers to a CRP meeting or deliberations or have access to their documentation.    The Resident representative designates an international staff member to serve as ex-officio non-voting member and secretary to the panel.    When reviewing cases of candidates for appointment to other organizations for whom the UNDP CRP is designated as the compliance review body, a representative of those organizations should be included in the meeting quorum.  This designation should be spelled out in the MoU with that organization.  Members from these organizations are appointed to the CRP in consultation with their local head of office.  When an appointment is for an organization without such an agreement but UNDP is the hiring agent, the relevant agency headquarters should be advised and confirm in writing their understanding and agreement to the CRP authority and proceedings.  CRP members are selected to serve on the CRP according to the following criteria:  Internal staff members in active service on Permanent and Fixed-term appointments (PA, FTA) at the G6 & NO level and above;  Preferably staff members with at least 3-4 years of service as staff within the UN system;  A sound knowledge of the UN Staff Rules and Regulations and the ability to interpret these rules and regulations;  Demonstrated familiarity with UNDP recruitment policies, principles and procedures as well as corporate guidelines;  Judgment, integrity, discretion: a willingness to speak on principle as well as a willingness to reach consensus;  Dedication to ensuring due process, fairness, equity, transparency and open competition.  Members can be appointed from any Headquarters, Regional Service Centre or Country office.  The Resident Representative or the officer-in-charge is not eligible to be a member.  The Resident Representative appoints new members to fill vacancies from other eligible staff.  At its first meeting of the year, the CRP elects its own Chair and Vice Chairs.  At this meeting, each member must be provided with the links to the following policies and documents:  Staff Rules and Regulations  Rules of Procedure for the CRP  POPP  UNDP Recruitment and Selection Framework and recruitment and selection policies including those on academic qualifications and family relationships  Cumulative listings of policy recommendations of previous CRPs (LAPPs)  Job Classification POPP and procedures  The CRP at its first meeting will establish its meeting schedule for the year.  This schedule may be adjusted as necessary and the CRP may be called to meet by the Resident Representative at any time for urgent reviews.  In order to allow adequate reviews, the agenda and all necessary documents will be communicated to members and alternatives at least one week (five working days) prior to the date of the Panel meeting.     Recommendations  Consensus recommendations are the expected norm.  It is the Chair and Vice Chair’s responsibility to facilitate discussions that arrive at consensus.  In the event that consensus cannot be reached, the Chair will call for a vote of all present members.  All members are not required when a vote is called. A simple quorum is sufficient.  The Chair does cast a vote and a simple majority is decisive.  All votes, including that of the Chair, are equal.  In the event of a tie, the Chair decides the outcome.  In order to avoid any conflict of interest or appearance thereof, a member will not participate in the review of recruitment or selection cases in which he or she has been involved in a way or another or is the subject of the selection or recruitment case under review or is a spouse or has any family relation (including those beyond mother, father, brother, sister, aunt, uncle niece or nephew) to the considered candidate.   CRP members will be appointed for a period of two years and shall serve a maximum of three consecutive years.   Job Reclassifications  In accordance with the current policies in job classification, in Country Offices, prior to submission of the classification case to the Resident Representative for approval (decentralized classification),  documents are submitted to the CRP which reviews the classification package, examines the completeness of the submission in terms of an adequately written job description, supporting documentation, justifications for reclassification of the position in question, changes in functions, availability of the position and budget, due classification process and makes recommendations to the Resident Representative.  Basic Documents and Procedures  For all appointments, including staff previously under the 100 or 300 series who have been selected for a higher level local FTA position, the CRP will be presented with information on all eligible and available candidates. This information will include an updated and signed UN Personal History Form (P.11) and indicate each candidate's name, function, professional background, qualifications and nationality.   For UNDP staff members and candidates from the UN Common System, relevant performance evaluation reports for at least the past two years will be provided.  No external candidate, including candidates from the UN Common System, will be presented for the CRP for review until all references have been conducted and academic qualifications have been verified [see Policy on academic qualifications and Recruitment and Selection Framework for reference checking].   The recruitment and selection case under review will include a UNDP CRP Submission Form together with: the vacancy announcement;  the completed P.11 of the proposed candidates under consideration; the competency-based assessment, the short list and long list memo, listing the different assessment/selection methods used; including the corporate interview report , the performance evaluation reports and the reference checking report;  the Hiring Manager’s summary, recommendation and justification for recruitment, and any other relevant information. Updated classification memo Hiring unit’s most recent organigram  The CRP submission form must clearly indicate the primary, recommended candidate put forth by the hiring manager.  When another candidate(s) has passed the selection process, he/she/they may be included in the submission as an alternate candidate(s). The submission of an alternate candidate is optional.    The primary candidate is the candidate, in the judgment of the Hiring Manager (HM) (not the interview panel), based on all the recruitment and selection data, that is best suited and/or the most appropriate candidate for the post.  The alternate candidate or candidates are those who in the judgment of the Hiring Manager meet all of the criteria for the post but are secondary in overall suitability to the primary candidate.  In the Hiring Manager’s submission, objective reasons for the designation primary and alternate candidates must be provided.    The CR Body reviews both the primary and alternate candidates and may endorse any, all, or none of the candidates presented.    When more than one candidate is endorsed, the primary candidate (or the highest candidate if the Primary Candidate is not endorsed) is appointed.  It may also recommend that either be retained by OHR for rostering against future vacancies.  The purpose of alternate (or secondary) candidates as part of the process is not to give the CR Body a voice in the substantive review or to create an additional step in the candidate evaluation process.  The HM alone is accountable for the recruitment and selection process and its results.   Reasons for endorsing an Alternate Candidate The recruitment process often generates more than one successful candidate.  Occasionally, a Primary Candidate must withdraw or becomes unavailable.  An Alternate Candidate allows the post to be filled with a fully qualified candidate without repeating the entire recruitment process.    As long as the recommended candidates, both primary and alternates, are suitable and their selection is found compliant, the CR Body is expected to endorse them.   A CR Body may find a substantive flaw in the recruitment process of the Primary Candidate which could be determined sufficient to endorse an Alternate Candidate.  In such a case, the HM should be consulted by the CR Body prior to non-endorsement for clarification or to obtain any relevant information.  A CR Body may propose that the alternate candidate be offered the post over a primary candidate to achieve corporate objectives such as order of retention, gender or regional representation.  However, the final decision as to which candidate the post should be offered remains with the Hiring Manager.   Given the investment in the selection process, in all cases of an Alternate Candidate endorsement instead of the Primary Candidate, it is highly desirable for the CR Body to consult with the HM as to any compelling issues that may be considered prior to final determination.     Conduct of Business  Normally, the cases are presented by the Administration (ex officio/secretary) and the CRP decides on its recommendations on the basis of written and oral presentation of the information contained in the CRP Submission Form. The CRP may request the Administration to provide additional information on any relevant matter and may call the hiring manager, and/or any other UNDP staff member involved in the recruitment process.  Reports, Recommendations and Records of Proceedings   As per Staff Rule 4.15(h)(ii), “The central review bodies shall review the process for compliance with the pre-approved selection criteria and shall offer recommendations”. Their role, therefore, is one of compliance review of the recruitment and selection process with established policy. The CRP insures that recruitments and selections to staff positions within UNDP comply with the applicable staff rules and UNDP corporate staffing policies.  (Please see Terms of Reference of the Compliance Review Bodies Para 8. a) through h) for complete details)  The CRP may make the following recommendations: Endorsement of the recruitment and selection process and of the candidate recommended by the hiring manager; Non-endorsement of the process and of the recommended candidate with explanation; Request for additional information for the purpose of further review of the case.  In the cases of recommendations (b) and (c), the hiring unit will be given the possibility to provide further clarification to the CRB before the final recommendation is made.   When in doubt regarding the proper application of the evaluation criteria and/or the applicable procedures, the Chair requests the Secretary (Ex Officio member representing Human Resources) to answer questions of members and clarify issues so that the Panel may proceeds to conclude their deliberations and move toward an endorsement for appointment.   If, after obtaining additional information, the panel finds that the evaluation criteria were improperly applied and/or that the applicable recruitment and selection procedures were not followed, the CRP Secretary transmits these findings to the Resident Representative without an endorsement for appointment.    Exceptional overruling of the CRP recommendation  In the exceptional cases where a hiring manager (i.e. the Resident Representative, the Director of a Regional Service Centre or the Head of an office outside New York) requests the overruling of the CRP recommendation, the properly documented request must be submitted to the Director OHR/BOM for recommendation to the relevant Bureau Director for final decision. If the hiring manager is a Bureau Director, the request is submitted to the Director OHR/BOM for recommendation to the Associate Administrator for final decision.  Records   The minutes of the CRP’s meetings will record decisions and recommendations of the CRP. They will also serve to record policy recommendations for future reference by successive CRPs. The minutes will be anonymous with respect to positions taken except when a member specifically requests to be identified with a statement, policy or decision.   All minutes will be signed by the Chair (or member who chaired the meeting) and will be kept by the Secretary. They will be made available on request to members.   The deliberations, all documentation, recommendations and reports of CRPs are strictly confidential.  All CRP members are to be informed upon their appointment of their obligation with respect to confidentiality.  Their written acceptance to serve on the CRP indicates their knowledge of this requirement and confirms their accountability to uphold it.  In country offices, the CRPs recommendations on appointment and selection are transmitted to the Resident Representative.  In other locations, it is to the head of office.   Candidates recommended by the Panel will have the status of “internal candidates” under staff previously 4.10 which will be recorded by HR of the country office.",
    "safe-driving-bonus-sdb": "Safe Driving Bonus    1. The purpose of the safe driving bonus (SDB) is to financially compensate drivers with an additional one week’s net salary at the end of each year for performing accident-free and safe driving functions on a regular basis, subject to the following conditions:     The driver has worked for the UNDP office since 1 January of that year     The driver has not been involved in any automobile accident considered to be his/her fault during the entire year     The driver has not been convicted of any traffic violation, such as reckless driving or going through a red traffic light, during the year. At the discretion of the Resident Representative, fines for improper parking need not be considered as a traffic violation for this purpose.  Eligibility    Locally recruited General Service (GS) staff members appointed as a driver under the Permanent or Fixed-Term Appointment governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, with a full year of service by 31 December, are eligible for the one-week salary bonus.    Locally recruited General Service (GS) staff members appointed as a driver under the Permanent or Fixed-Term Appointment governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, with between six and twelve months service by 31 December, are eligible for a prorated bonus based on the number of months served.    Locally recruited General Service (GS) staff members appointed as a driver under the Permanent or Fixed-Term Appointment governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, with less than six months service as of 31 December, are not eligible for the bonus.    Staff members who are holding a Permanent or Fixed-Term Appointment governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules and who perform split functions, e.g., driver/messenger, are eligible for the bonus, provided that the time spent in driving functions constitutes at least 30 percent of the calendar year.

Drivers earn service credit towards SDB during:     Annual leave (AL)    A continuous sick leave (SL) period of less than 30 days    A continuous special leave without pay (SLWOP) period of less than 30 days, or     A continuous special leave with full pay period (SLWFP) of less than 30 days      Exclusions    Drivers do not earn service credit towards SDB during a continuous:     SL period of 30 days or more    SLWOP period of 30 days or more; or     SLWFP period of 30 days or more    Payment of SDB is not taken into account in determining the following entitlements, where applicable:     Pensionable remuneration (safe driving bonus is not pensionable), contributions to, and benefits payable by the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), e.g., retirement benefits, surviving dependent(s) benefits    Compensation for service-incurred illness, injury, or death    Special post allowance (SPA)    Insurance premiums; and    Separation payments, e.g., commutation of annual leave, death benefit, termination indemnity, etc.     Payment Calculation    The SDB comprises one week’s net salary payable at the level and step of each eligible driver according to the criteria outlined in paragraphs 2 through 5 above.    Payment is calculated at the end of each calendar year on 31 December, for approval by the Resident Representative (RR).    If the applicable salary scale is subsequently revised and affects the December salary calculation, payment of the bonus is adjusted accordingly.    Payment Withheld    12. Payment of SDB is withheld in respect of any driver who is involved in an accident requiring review by the UNDP Property Survey Board, pending receipt of the Board’s decision. In cases where a SDB is withheld, a Personnel Action Form is prepared for record purposes.      ",
    "salary-advance": "Salary Advance Policy    Staff compensation, including salary, benefits and allowances are designed to meet normal living requirements of staff members and their dependents. When exceptional and unexpected situations occur and additional monies are needed, UNDP may extend an advance under specific circumstances and conditions defined in this Policy.  As UNDP is not a financial (lending) institution, staff members are advised to approach available lending institutions such as banks or the United Nations Federal Credit Union (UNFCU) for all personal financial needs.   This policy implements Staff Rule 3.16.  \t Applicability      Staff members holding Permanent, Fixed-term and Temporary Appointments, as well as holders of Regular International and National Personnel Services Agreements (IPSAs and NPSAs) may request, and UNDP may grant, a salary advance in accordance with the conditions described below.  Unless specified otherwise, the terms and conditions related to salary advances apply to all personnel types listed above.    General Conditions      The following conditions apply to all salary advances:    they are recovered in full through regular payroll deductions;    advances for internationally recruited staff members and IPSAs are always recovered in USD. Such advances can be disbursed in the local currency of the duty station.  Where an advance is paid out in a currency other than USD, the amount of that advance will be converted to USD at the official UN exchange rate in effect when the advance was issued, and that USD amount is what will be recovered;    locally-recruited staff members and NPSAs can only receive advances in the currency in which their salary is paid and the advance must be repaid in the same currency;    recovery begins with the first end-month pay day after the advance has been given unless otherwise stipulated at the time of the approval;   unless otherwise specified, they are liquidated at a constant rate of up to a maximum of twelve (12) consecutive pay periods not extending beyond the expiry date of the appointment / agreement;   no new advances may be granted while a previous advance or any part thereof is outstanding, except:    for advances for major medical expenses pending reimbursement by a UN medical insurance scheme; or    if based on security determinations and approved duty station-wide in accordance with the UNDSS Security Manual; or    for advances exceptionally approved in specific emergency situations by the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS.    the request for an advance must explain, in detail, the exceptional and unexpected situation for which the funds are needed and attach supporting documentation. It must also include a written undertaking that if the staff member / PSA holder separates from service, any outstanding balance of an advance is recovered in full against final emoluments. Any balance that exceeds the final emoluments due must be paid immediately and in full prior to separation.      Authorization of Salary Advances and Responsibility for Recovery    Requests for salary advances by locally recruited staff members and NPSAs outside of Headquarters (HQ) must be submitted using UNDP’s employee self-service platform along with the necessary documentation as required under this Policy. The request is reviewed and approved by staff designated with these roles in the Office. Typically, the Approver role is with the Head of Office (Resident Representative) who may delegate it to the Deputy Resident Representative (operations) or a similar function.    For locally recruited staff members and NPSAs at HQ, advances must be approved by the Director of the relevant office, who may delegate to the Deputy Director, or similar function.   The Office approving the advance is responsible for ensuring that the payment is being made and recovered in line with this Policy. The Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS may revoke the delegation of authority of the Head of Office, or Director of the staff member’s office, to approve salary advances if advances are approved in breach of this policy.    Except for personal emergency advances, salary advances of internationally recruited staff members and IPSAs, must be approved by both the Global Payroll Services (GPS) and Benefits & Entitlement Services (BES) Manager. The GPS and BES Managers are responsible for ensuring that all salary advances are approved and recovered within the framework of this policy. In the case of personal emergency advances, the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS must approve the salary advance.   Types of Salary Advances      Advances upon initial appointment      Where a staff member / PSA holder has not yet been enrolled in active payroll in Quantum HCM, a one-time initial appointment advance may be granted. Should a duplicate payment be disbursed, a recovery will be made in full in the next payroll.     Advances due to non-receipt of salary      Where a staff member / PSA holder does not receive a regular salary due to a banking or other technical issue or a partial first month salary due to timing of payroll processing, an advance shall be granted in the amount due. Should a duplicate salary be disbursed, a recovery will be made in full in the next payroll.     Advances upon separation from service      Where a staff member / PSA holder separates from service and final settlement of pay accounts cannot be made at the time of departure, an advance not exceeding 80 per cent of estimated final net payments due may be granted.    Advances for medical expenses    A staff member / PSA holder may, exceptionally, request a salary advance for major and unforeseen medical expenses incurred by them or a dependent recognized by UNDP. Request for such advances will be considered only if (i) the staff member / PSA holder, including the named dependent, are enrolled in an official UN medical Plan, (ii) direct billing/payment facility is not available between the health provider and the insurance company and (iii) the bills are required to be paid prior to receipt of insurance payment.    It is expected that most medical expenses will be covered by a UN medical insurance scheme. However, if a staff member / PSA holder or a dependent recognised by UNDP, incurs major medical expenses that are beyond the limits of the medical insurance scheme and is faced with undue financial hardship, a salary advance may be considered under the provisions for personal emergency salary advances.  The advance may not exceed the lowest of (i) two months’ net pay, (ii) the maximum reimbursable amount under the applicable medical insurance scheme or (iii) the amount of the hospital bill. Advances for medical expenses can be granted concurrently with an existing salary advance.  The advance for medical expenses must be settled through the applicable insurance scheme or by the staff member / PSA holder within four months from when the advance is granted.  Advances for pre-payment of rent  Internationally recruited staff members may be granted a rental advance where three or more months' rent must normally be paid in advance to secure accommodation as stipulated in the lease agreement. The request for advance must specify the amount of the rent, the number of months for which the lease agreement indicates it is to be prepaid, the amount and currency of the advance requested.  The number of months of advance must be in line with the normal practice for rental properties in the duty station as confirmed by the Head of Office.  The amount of the advance covers only rent; it does not cover security deposits (generally returned to tenant at the end of the lease), agents’ fees or recurring costs such as electricity, water or other utilities where these are paid separately from rent.  The amount of the advance will be recovered within the term of the lease for which the advance was requested or within the staff member’s current contract period, whichever comes first.  Advances for pre-payment of rent are not authorised for staff members assigned to Group I duty stations under the post adjustment system.  Advances for purchase of a private vehicle  Internationally recruited staff members from grades P-1 to P-4 may be granted a salary advance for the purchase of a private automobile of up to US$7,500.00 or the local currency equivalent at the prevailing United Nations Operational Rate of Exchange (UNORE, https://treasury.un.org/operationalrates/OperationalRates.php).  The requests for advance for this purpose will be considered, one-time only, within six months of initial appointment or reassignment. The Head of Office must certify that the vehicle is necessary in connection with the staff member's assignment.  The request for advance must specify the amount, currency and where the advance should be paid. Advances for the purchase of a private automobile are granted on the understanding that the staff member intends to keep the vehicle for at least two years or for the duration of the assignment, whichever is shorter.  Advances for the purchase of a private vehicle are not authorised for staff members assigned to Group 1 duty stations under the post adjustment system.  Staff members on Temporary Appointments are not eligible for this type of advance.  Emergency Advances   Bulk Emergency Advances to groups of staff members  Salary advances may be exceptionally approved to groups of staff members / PSA holders, in specific emergency situations by the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified at the time of approval.  Bulk salary advances as may be proposed by the Head of Office or United Nations Country Team (UNCT) to respond to an emergency situation in a duty station, must be approved by the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS.  Personal Emergency Advance  Staff members / PSA holders may be granted an advance for personal emergencies of up to two months’ net pay to meet genuine urgent, non-recurring, needs. These requests will be considered on the merit of each individual case, including evidence provided, and granted based on the best judgment of the Head or Director of the Office, in the case of locally recruited staff and NPSAs or the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS, in the case of internationally recruited staff and IPSAs.  Situations that may be considered for advances for personal emergencies include:    major expenses to repair a private residence damaged by natural or man-made disasters (e.g., fire, flooding, etc.). Advances of this type may often be approved on a duty station-wide basis as part of a Bulk Emergency Advance;  major expenses related to undertaking security-related measures (fences, alarm system, etc.) on a staff member’s / PSA holder’s primary residence based on written recommendation of the UNDP security officer or UNDSS and submission of a vendor invoice or estimate;  crimes causing serious financial loss, evidenced by an official police report or an insurance claim, to the staff member and/or dependent as recognized by UNDP;  funeral expenses in the event of death of an immediate family member;  expenses related to essential medical or dental procedures and treatments for staff members / PSA holders and/or their dependents as recognized by UNDP that are not covered by their insurance scheme and upon submission of a provider’s invoice or estimate.  Only one personal salary advance for emergencies may be granted during any twelve-month period.    Unauthorized Requests   Salary advances shall not be authorised for purposes outside those covered by this policy. These include but are not limited to the following:  weddings, parties, or other such gatherings;  school or college fees;  holiday or other personal travel;  purchase of a house or land;  construction of houses, buildings or extension of existing premises;  renovation or repair of houses or buildings through normal wear and tear;   purchase of household furnishings and personal effects;  payment of personal debts, bank loans or mortgages.   Annex: Summary of Payment, Recovery and Other Conditions    ",
    "salary-increments": "Salary Increments   The purpose of a within-grade salary increment from one step to the next higher step within the established salary scale is to award a staff member an increase in salary for satisfactory performance and conduct during a qualifying period.   Qualifying Period   The qualifying period is one year, except for movement to longevity steps as specified in the respective salary scale. For staff at or above P-2 step 12, P-3 step 14, P-4 step 13, P-5 step 11, D-1 step 5, and all steps at D-2, the qualifying period is two years. Award of the increment is subject to confirmation of the staff member’s satisfactory performance in his/ her assignments and conduct as evaluated by his/her supervisor(s) and documented in UNDP’s performance evaluation mechanism; and to the existence of a higher step within the staff member’s current grade in the respective salary scale. Periods of special leave with partial pay or without pay of 30 consecutive days or more are not counted in the qualifying period.   Eligibility  All staff members with Permanent, Continuing or Fixed-Term appointments governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules with an appointment of one year or longer are eligible for a salary increment, provided that the qualifying conditions as set out in paragraphs immediately above have been met.   Separating Staff   No increment is paid to a staff member who is due to be separated during the month in which the increment would have become due, unless the separation is to take effect on the last day of the month.   Long-Service Step   The long-service step is an additional step included in the local salary scales as a means of recognizing a staff member’s long service. The qualifying criteria for a long-service step apply to any staff member in the any staff member in the General Service (GS) and National Professional Officer (NPO) category having at least 20 years’ continuous service with UNDP or with UNDP and another organization of the UN Common System and which includes:   at least five years of service at the top step of the current level; and   satisfactory service   The long-service step does not apply in cases where longevity steps are already included in the local salary scales on the basis of local comparator practice as determined in the local salary survey.    The value of the step in net salary terms is the same as the within-grade increment in the corresponding level. The long-service step is pensionable.  Effective Date   Upon initial appointment:  The increment takes effect from the first day of the month when the staff member reaches the qualifying period of service, e.g., if the effective date of appointment is 15 July 2014, the increment is due on 1 July 2015.   Upon promotion to higher level:  The next increment at the promotion level is due on the first of the month of the anniversary date of promotion.   Upon granting of Special Post Allowance (SPA):  The next increment at SPA level is due on the first of the month of the anniversary date of granting of SPA.   After a staff member is given an initial appointment, his/her step within a salary level should not be altered for any reason other than the award of an annual salary increment.   Withholding of Salary Increment   The basis for the decision to award or withhold a salary increment on the basis of performance shall be the record of performance of the staff member as documented in UNDP’s performance evaluation mechanism.   The head of office has the authority to decide on withholding a staff member’s increment based on a written recommendation by the immediate supervisor that the staff member has not fully met the requirements of satisfactory performance and/or conduct during the preceding year.   If it is recommended that the salary increment be withheld, the head of office shall notify the staff member, in writing, one month before the increment is due, indicating the reasons for such recommendation. The staff member is allowed two weeks to submit written comments to the head of office, who then shall make the decision on withholding the increment. If it is decided to withhold the increment of the staff member’s salary, a Personnel Action Form reflecting the withholding of the increment shall be issued.   If the staff member objects to the withholding of the increment, the same procedures must be followed as in the case of a rebuttal of his/her performance evaluation.   The next increment may not be awarded until one year from the date the withholding of increment would have been due, and only then provided that the staff member’s performance is judged to be satisfactory. However, when the case involves longevity steps, the waiting period for the receipt of the next increment should be the same as the qualifying period between longevity steps. ",
    "salary-surveys": "Salary Surveys    1.  This section describes the different features in the setting of the salary scales between staff members in the Professional and higher categories and staff members in the General Service category under Permanent, Continuing or Fixed-Term appointments governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.     Professional and Higher Levels     2. The level of salaries for Professional staff is determined on the basis of the Noblemaire Principle, which states that the international civil service should be able to recruit staff from its member states, including the highest-paid ones. Therefore, the salaries of Professional staff are set by reference to the highest-paying national civil service.    The General Service and Related Categories     Staff in these categories are paid on a local basis. The level of salaries is established in accordance with the Flemming Principle, which provides that the conditions of service for locally recruited staff should reflect the best prevailing conditions found locally for similar work, with the aim of ensuring that the United Nations remains a competitive employer able to attract and retain high-calibre staff. In practice, this means that the salaries and conditions of service of locally recruited staff are established by reference to those of the presumed best employers in the locality, identified by means of a survey.     Consequently, the local salaries are established on the basis of salary surveys that facilitate the identification of the best prevailing conditions. The local salary surveys (non-headquarters duty stations) are conducted in accordance with a salary survey methodology approved by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC).     Professional and Higher Levels     5. The ICSC makes a periodic check to identify the national civil service of the Member State that has the highest pay levels and that, by its size and structure, lends itself to a significant comparison. The federal civil service of the United States of America has to date been taken as the highest paid national civil service.     The General Service and Related Categories     At non-headquarters duty stations, salary surveys are conducted by the responsible agencies and coordinated by the United Nations. In the large majority of locations, UNDP acts as the designated agency. However, the promulgation of all authorized local salary scales is the responsibility of the United Nations Steering Committee on Local Salary Surveys.    At headquarters duty stations, the  ICSC is responsible for conducting salary surveys and for recommending salary scales for final approval by the organizations concerned.     1   ",
    "selection-and-reassignment-policy-international-rotational-posts": "Selection and Reassignment Policy for International Rotational Posts    Purpose    This policy describes the approach and methodology for identifying and selecting candidates for international rotational posts within UNDP (hereafter referred to as „rotational posts‟) and for their reassignment from one rotational post to another.  A ‘rotational’ post  is one where the functions to be performed and competencies required for the post are identical, similar to, or relevant to other international professional posts in UNDP duty stations at multiple locations, or if the rotational nature of a specific post is otherwise in the interests of UNDP. This policy supersedes the policy and guidelines related to the QUARRY exercise and previous Reassignment Policy (circular UNDP/ADM/00/29). Guidance on recruitment procedures for international non-rotational post can be found in the Policy Recruitment and Selection for International Posts not Covered by Candidate Pools.  The selection and reassignment of staff members for rotational posts is governed by the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, the UNDP Recruitment and Selection Framework and by the UNDP policies and principles contained therein. The selection and reassignment of staff members in the Candidate Pools are not subject to the provisions on lateral moves as described in the Recruitment and Selection Framework.    Applicability     The present policy applies to all UNDP international posts from P-4 to D-1 designated as rotational and which are covered by a Candidate Pool.  However, it does not apply to the process for identifying and selecting candidates for UNDP Resident Representative (RR) posts, which is conducted at the inter-agency level.      Establishment of Candidates Pools    A Candidate Pool is a qualified, pre-assessed and evaluated, pre-endorsed group of candidates suitable to perform the functions of a substantially similar set of rotational posts in a given job family. [see para. 27 on assessment]     The functions to be performed by posts covered by a given Candidate Pool shall be defined with reference to UNDP job families and the UNDP Competency Framework. The posts to be filled by candidates from a given Candidate Pool should have similar competencies in order to ensure a likely matching of candidates within a defined set of posts.    The Director, Office of Human Resources (OHR) in consultation with Hiring Directors, will define the rotational posts to be filled from each Candidate Pool.     The following Candidate Pools will be established:    Senior Programme (Country Director and similar HQ-based posts) at the P-5 and D-1 levels;   Programme (Deputy Resident Representative/Deputy Country Director - Programme and similar  HQ-based posts) at the P-4 – P-5 level;   Operations (Deputy Resident Representative/Deputy Country Director - Operations and similar HQ-based posts) at the P-4 – P-5 level.    Additional Candidate Pools may be established or existing Candidate Pools re-defined, from time to time, based on evolving functional and organizational requirements.  Combined Deputy Resident Representative/Deputy Country Director Programme and Operations positions may be drawn from either the Programme or Operations Pool and individual staff may be a member of more than one Pool.    Becoming a Member of a Candidate Pool    An internal candidate is defined as an international staff member holding a Permanent Appointment (PA), Continuing Appointment (CA) or Fixed Term Appointment (FTA) approved by the Compliance Review Board (CRB) hereinafter referred to as an Advisory Body.     An internal candidate may become a member of a given Candidate Pool in one of three ways:    An internal candidate has demonstrated satisfactory performance in a post (either currently or previously) covered by the Candidate Pools;      An internal candidate has gone through a corporate assessment and evaluation process and is deemed ready for entry into a Candidate Pool (see paragraphs 27 - 37 below);     An internal candidate who has been recommended for a post covered by a Candidate Pool and who has been endorsed by the CRB as a suitable alternate candidate as of 31 July 2010.      Candidate Pools and Staff Selection    Members of a given Candidate Pool who are available for assignment/reassignment may bid for vacant or anticipated vacant posts in their Pool. Members of each Candidate Pool will be placed in either ‘Tier A’ or  ‘Tier B’ of a given Pool, defined as follows:    Candidate Pool Tier A:     An internal staff member occupying a rotational post, who is due for reassignment in the next 12 months;    An  internal staff member who, before becoming unassigned as a result of the completion of his/her tour of duty, was occupying a post covered by a Candidate Pool;    An internal staff member who was a member of a Candidate Pool before going on interagency exchange or Special Leave Without Pay (SLWOP), and who is returning from an inter-agency exchange or from SLWOP;    LEAD staff  in the final year of the LEAD programme, who have passed the corporate assessment and evaluation for a given Candidate Pool;    A National Officer, approved by a local Advisory Body who has passed the corporate assessment and evaluation for a given Candidate Pool and has met the two-year time-in-post requirements;    Candidate Pool Tier B: All other members of the Candidate Pool who are not available for reassignment, including:    Internal staff members approved by an Advisory Body who have completed less than two years in their current assignment, including UNDP staff members currently on interagency exchange;    Members of Candidate Pools who have been appointed to a non-rotational post but wish to remain in the Candidate Pools;    Internal staff members approved by an Advisory Body who are on SLWOP, and are not expected to return to UNDP in the current year;    Internal staff members approved by an Advisory Body that were due for reassignment but have a management waiver.      The Annual Demand Forecast    In the fourth quarter of each year, the Director, OHR will make a forecast within the context of UNDP’s Strategic Plan of the staffing needs of UNDP (the ‘demand forecast’). This forecast will consider corporate staffing requirements in the near-term (12-18 months) and over the longer term (4-5 years). The demand forecast will examine whether each Candidate Pool has a sufficient supply of candidates in terms of competencies, language skills and relevant experience. The forecast will take into account attrition rates, numerical short-falls, functional deficits, and gender and geographical diversity for each Pool. Headquarters Offices as well as Pool posts from the UNDP administered Funds and Programmes (UNV, UNCDF) will be included in the demand forecast.    The Director, OHR, in consultation with Bureau’s management, will make recommendations for building and/or replenishing the Candidate Pools. Replenishment targets will serve as priority areas for Bureau’s management following the annual performance management review cycle.     Selection of Internal Candidates for the Corporate Assessment and Development Programme    As part of the annual performance and career development review of staff, the Management of each Bureau will identify internal candidates to be considered for the corporate Assessment and Development programme for the Candidate Pools.     In order to be considered for participation in the corporate Assessment and Development programme for posts in a given Candidate Pool, a staff member must meet the minimum eligibility, academic and experience requirements as outlined in the Recruitment and Selection Framework.     In nominating candidates for the Assessment and Development programme, Bureau’s management will consider a staff member’s current job performance, relevant technical and managerial competencies, mobility profile, learning plan achievements, and academic and relevant work experience. They will also take into account the staff member’s career interests and preferences.     As there is a limit to the number of candidates that can be put forward for the Assessment and Development programme, being nominated by Bureau’s management carries no expectation of being selected for the programme.     A staff member will be consulted as to whether he or she wishes to participate in the Assessment and Development programme for a given Candidate Pool and will be put forward only with his or her consent.     Staff members who are already in a given Candidate Pool will be consulted each year as to whether they wish to continue in the Candidate Pool. A staff member who wishes to withdraw from a Candidate Pool must inform the Director, OHR, in writing.  By choosing to withdraw from a Candidate Pool, the staff member forfeits his/her right to be given a reasonable offer and will be subject to regular competition for future vacancies.    In identifying staff members for participation in the Assessment and Development programme, each Bureau’s management will indicate the specific Candidate Pool(s) for which the staff member is being put forward. Bureau’s management may put forward a staff member for more than one Candidate Pool in a particular year.    The recommendations of each Bureau’s management for participation in the Assessment and Development programme will be forwarded to the Director, OHR.  Assessment costs, including travel of candidates, will be covered by corporate resources.    For each Candidate Pool, the Director, OHR, will compile a list of staff members recommended for the Assessment and Development programme. The Director, OHR, may add or delete names on the list of recommended staff members, including staff members returning from inter-agency assignments or SLWOP or LEAD staff. The list of recommended candidates will be forwarded to the Corporate Panel for final review and endorsement.    The Corporate Panel will be responsible for reviewing and selecting from the list of recommended candidates those staff members who will be assessed for each Candidate Pool. The Corporate Panel will consist of one Deputy Director from each Bureau, and the Director, OHR.  It will convene at least once per year for this purpose.    Internal candidates in one Candidate Pool who are recommended for corporate assessment and evaluation for another Candidate Pool will be given priority consideration     The Corporate Assessment and Development Programme     A corporate review of proposed candidates for each Pool will be held at least once per year (or more frequently if required) to meet anticipated requirements. There will be a tailored assessment process for each Candidate Pool. When referring to ‘assessment’ for the Candidate Pools it is important to emphasize that OHR/BMS will employ a range of methods designed to evaluate suitability for a given Pool and provide developmental feedback to candidates, both suitable and not suitable for the Pool.  As such, an applicant may be deemed not yet ready to join the Candidate Pool    Candidates will undergo a holistic assessment and evaluation process to ascertain whether they have the competencies and aptitude to perform the functions expected of the Pool for which they are being considered.     Assessment and evaluation techniques and methodologies to evaluate selected candidates for a given Pool may vary with the competencies and the level of proficiency required. There will be three broad principles governing the assessment and evaluation, including consistency (the same assessment tools, standards and, to the extent possible, the same assessors for each candidate), transparency (that assessment standards and criteria are available to all) and alignment (that the assessment is not done in isolation to other human resources tools, but rather aligned to the RCA, feeder Pools, the Competency Framework and the UNDP learning domain).    The holistic, consistent, candidate assessment and evaluation process may include (but is not limited to) a combination of the following approaches:    RCA recommendations, comments and competency assessment;  An evaluation of  the candidate’s substantive knowledge, analytical skills and language ability relevant to the requirements for each Pool;  A multi-rater performance evaluation (360◦) designed around the managerial and leadership competencies relevant to each Pool;  A face-to-face behavioral (or competency-based) interview assessing the core and managerial competencies of proposed candidates;  A face-to-face interaction with an organizational consultant who will evaluate aptitude to assume management and leadership roles and who will also provide feedback on the multi-rater assessment;  References from the previous and current supervisors, both internal and external to UNDP.    Assessed nominees, based on merit and competence, may be rated in one of two categories in each Candidate Pool:    Suitable for one or both levels of the posts covered by the Pools;      Not yet ready for entry into the Pools.      Assessed nominees falling into the first category will be eligible for placement in the Candidate Pool Tier A or B.  As appropriate, they may be given a development and learning programme tailored to meet their development needs with the assistance of OHR/LRC. For candidates found not to be ready for placement in the Candidate Pool, OHR/LRC will articulate their development needs and work with them to ensure the design of individually tailored learning plans.     Once the assessment and evaluation process is complete, OHR will synthesize the results and submit recommendations to the Compliance Review Board (CRB) for endorsement, if required.     Consistent with the Rank-in-Post Policy, it is only upon taking up the higher level post to which he/she was selected through the Candidate Pool, that a staff member will be given that level. The placement of a staff member in a Candidate Pool has no effect on the personal grade of that staff member.  Furthermore, placement in a Candidate Pool does not create any expectancy, legal or otherwise, for renewal of appointment or conversion to another type of appointment.      All candidates will be informed whether they have been selected for the Candidate Pool and may also be given feedback on their relative strengths and areas requiring further development.      In the event that there are more candidates than needed to populate the Pool, the Director of OHR will determine which candidates will be placed in the Pool based on corporate demographics and anticipated business needs.  The additional candidates will be placed on a reserve list for future consideration.    Staff members who have undergone corporate assessment and evaluation and were deemed not yet ready for entry into the Pools, may be recommended for re-assessment and evaluation for that Candidate Pool after two years.    Identification of Posts to be included in the Reassignment Compendium     Hiring Units will provide a complete list of posts to be filled in the bi-annual reassignment exercise, including those positions encumbered by staff members due for reassignment, as well as those posts expected to become vacant through attrition in the following year. It is the responsibility of Hiring Units to inform, in writing, staff encumbering positions to be included in the bi-annual reassignment exercise.    When a vacancy is unanticipated or must be filled on an emergency basis, the hiring Bureau Director may request to fill a post outside of the bi-annual reassignment exercise. All such posts will be circulated electronically to Candidate Pool members.      The Director, OHR, through the Director, BMS, will forward the complete list of posts to be filled at the reassignment exercise to the Associate Administrator for approval.     The Hiring Unit will be responsible for drafting the post profile in conformity with the UNDP Recruitment and Selection Framework and the UNDP Competency Framework.     Application for Posts       Candidate Pool members shall bid for posts, indicating a reasonable number of posts with preferences indicated (up to 5 posts). Staff members are encouraged to identify at least one inter-Bureau move. Once accepting an offer of assignment, staff are required to honor that acceptance, unless it is in the interests of the Organization to offer an alternative assignment.    In bidding for a particular post, the staff member is expected to have given full consideration to the potential impact on mobility, family and other personal and professional considerations and should be ready to take up the post if selected.     Review and Short-listing of Candidates    Hiring Units shall have appropriate access to Candidate Pools for the purpose of reviewing candidates who have bid for posts in their respective Bureau/Office.  To assist the Hiring Units in their review, the following information shall be provided by OHR:    The updated list of members of each Candidate Pool, including those in Candidate Pools Tiers A and B.  The list of Candidate Pools‟ members who are unassigned;  The list of  posts designated to be filled from each Candidate Pool;   Results of the corporate assessment and evaluation of  candidates from the Candidate  Pools;  UNDP Personal History Form (P-11) of  candidates;  Information provided by candidates regarding interest and experience for certain types of assignments or situations; practice area focus; language and locations, etc;  All other documentation required from the candidates to complete their applications for the posts.   In reviewing potential candidates for posts, Hiring Units shall give priority consideration to candidates who are due for reassignment and other corporate priorities, including gender.    The Hiring Bureau shall provide to the Director, OHR, a brief, written statement identifying a list of candidates for each post, in the order of preference. The written statement should address the following:    Post requirements in relation to the background, competency profile and developmental expectations of the proposed candidates;  How the selection of the preferred candidate for a given post will advance UNDP‟s talent needs and corporate priorities.     The Director, OHR, through the Director, BMS, will present the written proposals to the Associate Administrator for review prior to the reassignment meeting.    The Bi-Annual Reassignment Exercise Meetings    A Bi-Annual Reassignment Exercise will be conducted twice per year for the purpose of selecting candidates to fill international rotational posts anticipated to become vacant.    The Director, OHR, will confirm with the Hiring Bureau Directors those staff members who are due for reassignment or are otherwise available.  Staff members due for reassignment will be so notified by OHR.    Management may request to delay a staff member’s reassignment. The request must be made in writing to the Director of OHR.    The Reassignment Exercise will be conducted through meetings chaired by the Associate Administrator and with the participation of the Bureau Directors and the Director, OHR. OHR/BMS will serve as Secretariat for the meetings. Urgent posts that are advertised outside of the compendia will be reviewed electronically by the Associate Administrator and Bureau Directors.  Some positions may also warrant additional oversight and may be reviewed by the Management Group (MG) and the Administrator.     Selection of Candidates    There is no expectation that a member of a Pool will automatically be considered for a higher level post.    All candidates of the Tier A of a given Candidate Pool will be given full consideration for the posts for which they have applied and are eligible for. In the event that no suitable candidate is found in Tier A for a given post, Hiring Directors may consider candidates from Tier B, with the principle that staff having completed two years in their current position will be given priority for selection. If staff have not completed two years in their current assignment, and wish to be considered for a particular post, they will require a waiver from the Associate Administrator.    In the interests of the Organization, where no other candidate is otherwise found suitable for a particular post, a candidate in Tier A who is due for reassignment may be selected for a post for which he or she has not applied. In such cases, the candidate will be consulted prior to the selection decision becoming final (see reasonable offer).      Priority in selection will be given to candidates on the basis of corporate considerations, consistent with Staff Rules and articulated corporate priorities.    OHR/BMS, may request re-consideration of a staff member who is unassigned. In such cases where the staff member is not selected for a post, the reasons for non-selection must be documented.    Following notification to affected staff members, a global announcement will be issued from OHR/BMS providing information on the decisions taken at the meeting.     In the event that a reasonable offer of reassignment is made and the staff member does not accept it, the Organization will not initiate any further placement action and, under exceptional circumstances, the staff member may be removed from the Pool.    Staff members who will reach their mandatory retirement age before the completion of the expected tour of duty in their next assignment retain their eligibility and may bid for posts.  No placements will affect the requirement to retire upon reaching the mandatory retirement age.       Removal from a Candidate Pool    60. It is a clear expectation that if a staff member undertakes to join a Candidate Pool, then he or she will be willing to serve UNDP in a variety of functions in a variety of locations including, in crisis and post crisis countries, and non-family duty stations.  A candidate may be removed from the Candidate Pool in the following circumstances:    Separation from UNDP;   The staff member has requested in writing that he or she be withdrawn from the  Candidate Pool;  Refusal of a reasonable offer without legitimate justification;  After having actively competed for compendia positions, failure to be selected for reassignment for two years while in Tier A.   Furthermore, the status of staff members who have been in Tier B for four years or more will be reviewed on a periodic basis.     Individually Advertised Vacancies    Any exceptions to fill a post in a Candidate Pool externally must be requested in writing to the Associate Administrator.  If a post is advertised externally, all candidates will be required to meet the assessment and evaluation standards of the given Pool, including using the same assessment methodology, to the extent possible.    In the event that a post open for reassignment was not filled at the reassignment exercise meeting and remains vacant, the position may be individually advertised after the meeting concludes, either internally or both internally and externally.

",
    "service-contract": "Service Contract    The policy has been revised to address changing conditions and responds to country office recommendations calling for more clearly established rules and instructions. This revision supersedes the 1998 version of the Service Contract User Handbook.   The Director of OHR has delegated to UNDP Resident Representatives full responsibility and accountability to issue and manage SCs in accordance with this User Guide.  The Resident Representatives may delegate the responsibility for proper use of SCs to the “Responsible Officer”, who manages the planning and contracting of human resources necessary to meet the office goals, objectives and work plan.  Relevant Policies  Basic Principles   The service contract (SC) is a modality for hiring individuals under a non-staff contract.    The SC is a decentralized contracting instrument, which is cost effective and flexible for use only by UNDP country offices and regional centres outside of Headquarters. The SC is not for use in HQ duty stations and Liaison Offices e.g. New York, Geneva, London, Madrid, Montreal, Paris, Rome, Vienna, Brussels, Copenhagen, Geneva, Tokyo and Washington.  Payment under the SC is based on services satisfactorily provided in accordance with the terms of reference under the SC. The payment terms can be based on (i) all-inclusive lump-sum monthly payments, where cash payments are included for pre-existing social security as described in the Section on Social Security Arrangements below or (ii) monthly remuneration with provision of a local social security scheme where applicable and legally feasible, see Annex I  Legal Framework  As individuals contracted under SC, they are not staff and therefore, are not covered by UN Staff Regulations and Rules.   The SC is a legal document between UNDP and the individual contracted and must be concluded on the basis of the contract template form, attached hereto as Annex I. The SC cannot be modified without consultation with, and clearance of, the OHR Policy Unit and the Legal Office (LO). The SC is governed by this User Guide.   An annex to the SC provides conditions of service, and the individual is entitled only to those conditions as provided for in the SC.   By signing the SC, individuals acknowledge and accept that the terms of engagement are different from those that apply to UNDP staff and that there are no expectations for contract renewal.  Social Security and other conditions of the SC are generally consistent with what is called for in the local labour market for similarly situated services, except where UNDP has defined a minimum or maximum standard. For example, a maximum termination indemnity is established for all SC holders, irrespective of local practice; a minimum standard of 16 weeks is set for maternity leave, irrespective of local practice.  Although UNDP Offices are to take into account local conditions in establishing the appropriate remuneration for the market, this must not be construed as subjecting UNDP or the SC to national legislation. As this is a UNDP contract, it cannot be subjected to national legislation. Adherence to the User Guide by the UNDP Office is essential in protecting UNDP’s legal interests.  The individuals engaged under a SC are neither staff members nor “officials” for the purpose of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations of 13 February 1946. They may however, be given the status of “experts on mission” in the sense of Section 22 of Article VI of the Convention. Such determination is made in each case by the Secretary-General who alone has the authority to assert immunity on behalf of the Organization. If they are required to travel on behalf of UNDP, they may be given a UN certificate in accordance with Section 26 Article VII of the Convention.   The services performed by an individual engaged under a SC, do not carry any authority either directly or by delegation, to legally bind UNDP or otherwise enter into any agreements or financial obligations on behalf of UNDP with other international organizations, governments, legal entities or individuals.  Individuals engaged under a SC serve in their individual capacity and not as representatives of a government institution, corporative body or other authority external to UNDP.   Individuals that are employed or affiliated with a government institution, corporate body or other authority external to UNDP must provide evidence that they have been accorded special leave without pay, or a similar status, from their employer prior to being engaged under a SC. Notwithstanding the disclosure, the individual engaged under a Service Contract is bound by the principle of impartiality as specified in paragraph i) above and in the contract.  During the period of service with UNDP, individuals engaged under SC are required to uphold the standards of conduct set forth in their contract and the ST/SGB/2002/9 a copy of which must be provided to all SC holders upon signature of the SC. SC holders may not engage in any activity that is incompatible with the discharge of their duties with the Organization. They are to exercise the utmost discretion in all matters of official business of the Organization. They may not communicate at any time to any person, government, entity or authority external to UNDP, any information known to them by reason of their association with UNDP which has not been made public, except in the course of their duties or by authority of the UNDP Administrator or  the designate, nor shall they use the information for private advantage. These obligations do not lapse upon cessation of their service with UNDP.  No individual under a SC can be engaged in any activity in conflict with the obligations under the SC or in public employment, except for teaching at academic institutions, as set out in the standards of conduct in the SC. In cases of activities outside of the SC, including employment, the SC holder must immediately notify the UNDP Office for final determination by the UNDP Office as to the appropriateness of the activity.   The Responsible Officer must inform the SC holder of this requirement during the initial orientation upon engagement.  Copyright in any materials produced by the SC holder while they are engaged under a SC and within the scope of the SC vests in UNDP.   When to Use an SC  The SC is intended for engaging individuals under the following conditions:  national personnel or others legally authorized to work in the country;  for non-core support services in the UNDP Office that would normally be outsourced to a company, i.e. custodial, security and IT service, refer to ST/IC/2005/30 document on outsourcing;    for development project personnel, where UNDP on request of an executing entity, or implementing partner under the harmonized operational modalities (hereinafter “executing entity/implementing partner”) or, where UNDP itself serves as implementing partner of a development project, provides personnel contracting services to support execution or implementation of the project; the SC issued will be limited to services to that project only and   No authority other than UNDP may issue a UNDP SC. Therefore, an executing entity/implementing partner issues its own contracts, but may use the UNDP SC as a guideline.  See Annex IV, which provides a matrix on how to use the SC.  For any of the above activities that are less than 6 months, the IC contract must be used except in the case of exceptional situations as mentioned in section  40.   Improper Use of the SC  The following are examples of the improper use of the SC:   hiring international personnel;  hiring local office personnel for core functions (i.e. staff functions that are of a continuing nature and are part of UNDP’s central work, except  support services that would normally be outsourced to a company and functions that are within the development project context);   hiring local office personnel to perform internal control functions. Refer to Annex VI for the list of minimum control functions that must not be undertaken by individuals holding a Service Contract.   as a form of probation for possible conversion to core functions within the management project;  as means to minimize or inflate compensation; and  as means to complement duties of non-performing staff or staff on any type of leave.  SC holders can participate in Staff Council/Association events that are open to the larger UN/UNDP community. However, a SC holder cannot hold representational or decision making roles on matters that concern staff members such as, participation in Compliance Review Boards or Panels (CRB/CRP), and Contracts, Assets and Procurement (CAP) Committees or serve as the Chair or offices of the Staff Council/Association as these roles, by definition apply to staff serving on appointments under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.   Individuals engaged under SC cannot supervise UNDP staff holding temporary, fixed-term, continuing or permanent appointments under the Staff Rules. However, a SC may supervise another SC holder or IC depending on the nature of their functions. Competition for temporary or fixed term appointment positions  When applying for UNDP positions under the TA/FTA of the Staff Rules, individuals holding SCs are to be considered as external candidates.  Therefore, all processes applied for external   candidates must be followed. However, a SC holder can be given priority consideration through a transparent and competitive process in accordance with the Guiding Principles listed in the Recruitment and Selection Framework.  Conversion from Individual Contract (IC) to SC  When individuals have been on IC, and the duration of the functions and other requirements set forth in this User Guide qualify for the use of a SC, it is appropriate to convert such individuals to SCs based on the following principles:   the competitive process used to engage the IC was consistent with the process required for engagement of an SC,   special attention must be paid to explain the range of conditions of service, including social security coverage;  The rate of remuneration would be based on the SC remuneration scales for the location, including the addition of social benefits or payment in lieu thereof, as described in this User Guide.  the offer letter issued by the UNDP Office must specify the change in status and in benefits, and request the individual to sign the letter attached to the offer in the form set forth below:   \"I understand that my form of contract with UNDP is being changed as of (date), from an \"Individual Contract (IC)\" to that of a \"SC\". I also understand that the main purpose of this change is the extended duration. The change in my contractual status and in my remuneration and benefits has been explained to me. In accepting these arrangements, I understand that issuance of the SC does not entitle me to any adjustments or benefits in respect of my prior service with UNDP under IC signed _________”.  Staff members under temporary, fixed term, continuing or permanent / appointments  UNDP staff members that perform functions that are central to UNDP’s core work and hold contracts under temporary, fixed-term, continuing or permanent appointments must not be separated for the purpose of issuing a SC.   Former staff members that are separated on grounds of disciplinary action or unsatisfactory performance are not eligible for a SC.    Staff members separated for abolition of post or reduction in posts cannot be offered a SC with the same functions they occupied before separation. In the case of separation by retirement or abolition of post, the break in service requirement governing the separation must be strictly adhered to. No exception shall be granted to the minimum break in service period.  Any offer of a SC to a staff member who has separated by resignation must be made after a break in service of at least 1 month.  Budget Planning  Budget planning and funds sufficiency checks must be carried out prior to the processing and approval of hiring and extension of all SCs. Although the terms of reference for a SC require a job title it is not subject to ICSC classification standards.    UNDP Offices must ensure that monetary budget allocations have been approved for the full duration of the initial SC in order to engage individuals to work in the UNDP Office.    If the SC is to continue during a financial year beyond the initial contract period, UNDP Offices must ensure that budget provision is made and incorporated in the request for allotment for the relevant financial year.  Request for project budget allocations must include a description of the activity to be carried out, the duration of the activity, and an estimated annual cost for each contract including social security contributions over and above the gross pay. The Responsible Officer should ensure that the budget allocations include the pro forma costs for all expenditures related to the SC, such as insurance, security,  learning, payroll charges, performance bonuses and overtime, where relevant (refer to Annex III for check list and the proforma costs for SC holders.       Remuneration Structure and Pay Setting Principles  Establishing pay guidelines at the local level   The basis for the establishment of conditions of service for Service Contract (SCs) holders is found in the local labour market.  Therefore, the remuneration package for Service Contracts must be consistent with prevailing levels of pay for similar services and comparable work in the local labour market. The creation of Service Contract remuneration scales is a process and responsibility primarily managed by Country Offices. The Director of the UNDP Office of Human Resources (OHR) has therefore delegated to UNDP Resident Representatives full responsibility and accountability to collect and analyze data locally to create and update Service Contract remuneration scales.   The design of the system of remuneration for Service Contracts is based upon broad bands in an integrated pay structure to provide for wide pay ranges which support both flexible contracting and pay movement through performance measures as further set out in the Handbook on Setting Remuneration for Service Contract Personnel.  Country Offices are expected to comply with the structural guidance that will make the process straight forward and consistent across duty stations while preserving the flexibility needed to be effective at the local level  The Resident Representatives may delegate the responsibility for setting of SC remuneration scales to the “Responsible Officer”, who manages the planning and contracting of human resources necessary to meet the office goals, objectives and work plan.  The OHR Headquarters unit responsible for Policy and Compensation are responsible for providing advisory support and guidance to Country Offices in the setting of remuneration for SCs. Organizational reporting mechanisms will be established on a periodic basis to ensure the proper setting of SC remuneration.   Pay setting for individuals hired under a SC  \tPay setting for individuals contracted will be determined on the basis of the following:  a)   Level of the responsibility, which can be expressed in five broad bands or ranges:   First range: SC1-2, representing work in the custodial, maintenance, security, driving and messenger areas; this would be considered mechanical and physical operations;   Second range: SC3-4, representing work of a more basic processing support nature covering clerical, secretarial, certain technical functions; this work requires appropriate educational background and relevant work experience;  Third range: SC5-7 representing work of a specialized and comprehensive support nature progressing to integrated execution at the higher level; this work requires appropriate educational background and relevant work experience;  Fourth range:  SC8-9 representing work of an analytical nature requiring basic conceptual comprehension; this work requires appropriate educational background and relevant work experience;  Fifth range:  SC10-11 representing work of a conceptual, analytical and advisory nature at the higher professional level related to development, humanitarian and emergency project work that require substantive innovation and may involve some functions that are supervisory in nature to oversee project activities. Qualifications at this level include a postgraduate degree and relevant experience commensurate with the job.  The pay ranges established are for the purpose of having an objective and analytical basis for setting the levels of pay for individual contracts to ensure objectivity and non-arbitrariness in pay setting and also to avoid any basis for charges of under or over-payment in relation to the market or of favoritism in setting pay rates. Further guidance in \taligning the TOR to the pay ranges can be found in the Handbook on Setting Service Contract Remuneration.  Pay adjustment  After a SC is issued the level of remuneration established on initial contract must not be adjusted for any reason. In the event that the SC is extended, the pay will either remain the same or be adjusted if the remuneration scale has been revised in accordance with the Handbook on Setting Service Contract Remuneration. If upon renewal of the SC it is established that the level of remuneration has surpassed the market rates for similar situated services, the level of the remuneration remains unchanged with no adjustment for each contract renewal until the gap is closed.   Currency of Remuneration  The SC stipulates a fixed level of remuneration in local currency and payments are made in local currency, except in duty stations where it is the common practice of organizations that are retained as comparators for setting the SC remuneration scale, make remuneration payments in a currency other than the local currency. If the remuneration scale is denominated in a currency other than the local currency and is paid in local currency, the UN prevailing rate of exchange must be applied.  Payment of remuneration to SCs in currencies other than the local currency should be based upon documentary evidence of similar practice by all the surveyed and retained employers and confirmation of legality by the appropriate national authorities.  Remuneration Subject to Taxation  The total remuneration paid to individuals engaged under a SC must be specified in gross terms. The remuneration paid to the SC is not exempt from national or local taxation. UNDP is not responsible for payment of tax on earnings or other taxes due on the remuneration of the SC, nor is UNDP responsible for reimbursement of taxes paid by SC holders in respect of earnings received under SC with UNDP. The payment of taxes is the sole responsibility of the individual under SC. UNDP reserves the right to request proof of payment of taxes by the SC holder. In certain cases, national governments exempt SC holders from payment of taxes. Such exemption is solely within the purview of the national government and cannot be based on representations by UNDP that SC holders are exempt.   The UNDP Office must not be involved in making payroll deductions for the purpose of remitting monies to the national tax authorities, nor is it required to report the earnings of SC holders to the tax authorities. The UNDP Office must notify the SC holder upon entry that  the SC holder must be in compliance with  their national taxation obligations.  This is also detailed in the SC template.    In some cases, Governments have concerns that SC holders are not complying with their tax obligations. In such cases where Governments request information from the UNDP Office relating to SC holders, it is appropriate to do the following:  Provide the Government with the names of SC holders in the country and general information on pay scales and inform the Government that UNDP does not provide specific financial information relating to particular individuals;  Inform the SC holders that the UNDP Office has provided their names and general pay scales to the Government and remind them that they must be in compliance with their tax obligations; and  Advise the Government that the UNDP Office has notified SC holders as set forth in item b) above.  UNDP Offices may consult the OHR Policy Unit and the Legal Office on such government   queries as necessary.  Overtime  While overtime work is generally discouraged, situations arise when it is necessary for individuals engaged under a SC to work more than the established work hours. In such cases overtime pay may only apply to SB1 to SB3 levels and shall not exceed 40 over time hours per month; SC holders engaged in the higher ranges are not subject to overtime pay.  As with the overall remuneration package, the rate of overtime pay is based on the local market.  In locations where the local labour practice is not specific on the amount of time that constitutes overtime and corresponding compensation, where local practice favors cash payments, subject to budgetary considerations, overtime shall be compensated on the basis of one and half the normal rate. Where local practice favors compensatory time off, subject to exigencies of service, SCs shall be compensated on the basis of one and half the normal rate. The compensatory time off must be utilized within four months following the month in which the overtime work is done, otherwise it is forfeited.   Overtime pay must be requested and approved by the supervisor in advance of the extra work period to be performed, subject to the availability of funds.  The cost of overtime pay must be funded from the same source as the SC itself. UNDP Offices must ensure that sufficient funds exist for functions that may reasonably expect payment of overtime.  Overtime pay must be monitored closely and kept to a minimum.   Performance Bonus  The Performance Bonus for individual Service Contract holders is governed entirely through service quality assessment. The decision to grant a Performance Bonus is not automatic or granted as an entitlement.  During the Service Quality Evaluation process, the Supervisor of the SC holder makes a recommendation for a Performance Bonus and confirms that the individual has met all the contract objectives and the performance was more than satisfactory.  In assessing the performance, Country Offices consider the quality of the individual’s services in comparison to the performance of other SC holders conducting similar services. The Resident Representative has sole discretion to approve recommendations for Performance Bonuses based on the Service Quality Evaluation and the availability of resources under the project.  The Performance Bonus is a one-time payment granted to a SC Holder at the end of a twelve month contract after the service quality assessment. The Performance Bonus is calculated as a percentage of 1 to 3% of the gross annual remuneration rate that was in effect at the time of the evaluation taking into consideration the level of quality of service performance. Refer to Remuneration Handbook for further guidance.  UNDP Offices must ensure that budget provision is made for performance bonuses and is incorporated in the request for allotment in advance for the relevant financial year.  Danger Allowance  In addition to the base monthly remuneration, SCs who serve in locations where dangerous conditions prevail as determined by the ICSC are paid a Danger Allowance.  The Danger Allowance is payable based on presence at the duty station.  SCs on maternity, paternity, annual or sick leave continue to be eligible as long as they remain in the duty station. The Danger Allowance is also payable for time away from the designated duty station on official duty travel up to a maximum of seven consecutive calendar days including weekends and holidays falling during that period.  Payment ceases from the eighth day of official duty travel.  If the SCs travel on mission to another location that qualifies for Danger Allowance, they will receive Danger Allowance at the rate of that location instead of the rate of their parent duty station. Danger Allowance is not payable for days spent away from the duty station on annual leave or any type of special leave. Payment of Danger Allowance is lifted when dangerous conditions are deemed to have abated. Danger allowance shall be paid at the Danger Pay rate established at the duty station for locally recruited staff.  It is paid aAtlass a monthly lump-sum.  For SC holders who spend one complete month in the area where the allowance is applicable, the monthly sum is paid irrespective of the number of days in the month.  For periods of less than one month, the amount of danger allowance is prorated on the basis of 365 days; the daily rate is calculated by dividing the annual amount by the number of days actually spend at the duty station.  Danger Allowance is payable for a minimum of one day and is not prorated on an hourly basis.  Processing SC payments   The payments for SCs are processed through the global payroll module in Quantum.   Use of the SC for other UN agencies  UN Funds and Programmes (UNFPA, WFP, UNOPS and UNAIDS, etc.), which traditionally share UNDP's administrative and contracting machinery, may wish to use the SC modality, in the interests of simplification and harmonization processes led by the United Nations Development Group.   In such cases, they issue the SC in their own name, and can draw on this User Guide as a reference.  Alternatively, when UNDP is called upon to issue SCs on behalf of other UN bodies, such services must be provided on the basis of a MoU with the requesting UN body.  When an agreement is reached between a UN body and UNDP to issue SCs, the SC modality will follow this User Guide, except that the service contract must specify that it is limited to service with the requesting UN body.  The agreement between UNDP and the requesting UN body must provide that in issuing these contracts UNDP does not incur an additional liability - legal, financial or otherwise. The agreement must further specify that claims and costs resulting from the use of the SC must be the responsibility of the requesting UN body, and not of UNDP except in the case of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of UNDP.   All such agreements must be cleared by the OHR Policy Unit and the Legal Office.  UNDP Offices must ensure that their costs are recovered when providing such service in line with UNDP’s cost recovery policies.   Social Security Arrangements  Social Security coverage in one form or another is obligatory and must be guided by local conditions. Most importantly, such coverage must be provided in such a manner so as not to create legal implications for UNDP under the local law. Such coverage shall be in place from signature of the SC by UNDP and the SC holder.  Coverage under the service incurred disability/injury/ death sections is at no cost to the individual.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Medical Insurance  Individual SC holders may remain in a pre-existing medical scheme, whether through previous employment, a spouse or other source. In such case, UNDP provides a cash amount equivalent to both employer and subscriber’s contribution, as part of the monthly remuneration, provided there is proof of coverage and the cash amount does not exceed the monthly fee amount for the SC medical insurance contract with Cigna, offered by UNDP. The individual must present proof of participation and coverage at the commencement of the SC. The UNDP Office is responsible for verifying that the individual has adequate coverage. The SC must notify the UNDP Office of any change in coverage during the term of the SC as provided in the SC. The payment of cash for medical insurance, without the individual having coverage, is not permitted. The SC must stipulate the manner in which coverage for health benefits is provided.  Alternatively, the UNDP Office may make arrangements for medical coverage under a local private scheme provided that the premium is lower than the global Cigna International \"Group Life, Disability & Medical insurance plan\" and that the scope of coverage meets the standard established under the Cigna plan.   In such case, UNDP remits the full premium directly to the private scheme.  This option is not available if the premiums under this scheme are more than the monthly premium under the Cigna Plan.  In the case that the Cigna coverage is used, the premium is established in US dollars. The local currency value must be determined monthly on the basis of the UN operational rate of exchange.  The premium must be collected and remitted monthly at the time of processing the remuneration in order to have coverage. Only the premium for the SC holder is subsidized by UNDP.  UNDP does not subsidize Cigna medical insurance for the SC holder’s recognized dependents. The SC holder may choose to enroll dependents recognized by UNDP within 30 days of the starting date of their service contract, provided the SC holder pays the full premium for them. These premiums are collected by means of a payroll deduction every month.                     In countries where a national medical scheme exists, individuals under SC may contribute directly to such a scheme, if permitted. To use this option, the UNDP Office must receive adequate evidence that the individual has coverage.  It is not permitted to include an amount for medical coverage in the SC remuneration where no coverage is in place. Under this arrangement, the UNDP Office contributes the actual monthly cost of the insurance. This option is only available where UNDP has no obligation to contribute directly to the national scheme, as it cannot be subject to the national scheme.  UNDP Offices must ensure that all SC holders have adequate medical coverage. UNDP Offices are also responsible for ensuring that no SC holder travels on UNDP mission travel outside the country of residence without arranging medical coverage under Cigna or other local private scheme for the duration of the mission, at no cost to the SC holder.   Group Life and Disability Insurance  All persons hired on a SC must be covered for service incurred disability/injury/death, at no cost to the SC holder.   SC holders must be enrolled under the global Cigna \"Group Life, Disability & Medical insurance plan which provides cover for death and permanent disability as a result of any cause. In the event of death and disability as a result of any cause, a claim must be submitted under the \"Group Service-Incurred Death and Disability Insurance Plan\" for compensation through Cigna.   UNDP Offices may arrange a local scheme for Life and Disability insurance provided that the premium is lower than the global Cigna \"Group Life, Disability & Medical insurance plan\" and that the scope of coverage meets the standard established under the Cigna plan. Otherwise, UNDP Offices must use the Cigna plan arranged by UNDP Headquarters.   The current premium for the Cigna scheme is $8.88 per month. This amount must be paid by the UNDP Office in respect of each contract holder. The premium is established in US dollars. The local currency value must be determined monthly on the basis of the UN operational rate of exchange.  The premium must be collected and remitted monthly at the time of processing the remuneration.   The UNDP Office must maintain a record in Quantum or Payroll of amounts collected, should there be any questions or audit at a later date.   No monthly/quarterly report showing names of covered individuals will need to be submitted to Cigna. However, if the UNDP Office is covering SC holders with the Cigna insurance, regular monthly premiums must be accounted for each month without exception.  For this premium amount, subject to the Cigna policies in place, the SC holder would be eligible to receive up to the ceiling established under this benefit for permanent total disability and, in the event of the SC holder’s death, the surviving spouse and/or dependents would receive up to the ceiling established under this benefit.   Claims for death or disability  In the event of death of a SC holder, the UNDP Office must promptly notify the insurance company. Information surrounding the death, contractual status and other documentation must be provided by the UNDP Office as requested by the insurance company.  In the event of a service incurred disability which prevents the SC holder from continuing to perform according to their contract, a claim can be submitted under the \"Group Service-Incurred Death and Disability Insurance Plan\" for compensation through Cigna, or under the local scheme established by the UNDP Office.   Each UNDP Office must ensure it has a copy of the policy on file since the claim procedure is set forth therein. The current certification required by  Cigna for settlement of death, service-incurred injury or disability claims is:   a report from the UN examining physician;  evidence of  valid contract at the time of death or disability; and  an indication that the premiums have been paid throughout the contract.   The UNDP Office must have on file the original entry medical report, should there be any question regarding the medical condition of the SC holder.  Pension benefits  The UNDP Office must ensure that individuals engaged under SC are covered under a pension age plan as appropriate.  Coverage may be provided through one of the following options, and the SC must stipulate which option is selected:  A private group scheme, if available locally, which can be a cost-effective approach for all SC holders in the country.  The UNDP Office makes the appropriate payments directly to the scheme, for all individuals engaged under SC. The contribution of the UNDP Office to a private scheme must be accounted for at the time of processing payments in Quantum.  The UNDP Office must maintain a record of its contributions to the private social security scheme in its permanent record keeping system.  Another alternative is for the individual SC holder to remain in a pre-existing private scheme. To use this option, the UNDP Office must receive adequate evidence that the individual has coverage.  It is not permitted to include an amount for social security in the SC remuneration where no coverage is in place. Under this arrangement, the reasonable and customary amount of the premium for the location is added to the lump sum remuneration package.    In countries where a national social security scheme exists, individuals under SC may contribute directly to such a scheme, if permitted. To use this option, the UNDP Office must receive adequate evidence that the individual has coverage.  It is not permitted to include an amount for social security in the SC remuneration where no coverage is in place. Under this arrangement, the reasonable and customary amount of the premium for the location is added to the lump sum remuneration package. This option is only available where UNDP has no obligation to contribute directly to the national scheme, as it cannot be subject to the national scheme.  In countries where no pension scheme is in place or where there is only a national scheme that does not permit direct participation by the SC holder, a lump sum equivalent to 8.33% of the monthly remuneration rate is provided. This option is approved by the Director, OHR on an exceptional basis for the duration that no pension scheme is in place and is subject to review every twenty four months thereafter. The extension of the lump sum option is approved by the Regional Bureau upon certification by the Office that there continues to be no other viable pension scheme available.   The  initial request for approval of the lump sum option must be submitted to the Director OHR through the respective HR Business Advisor at Headquarters, prior to issuance of the SC. The request must confirm that all criteria for the lump sum has been met with all documented proof kept on file should there be an audit check at a later date. The Country Office must specify this option in the contract; the SC holder must sign a Certificate of No Contest that confirms agreement to receive the pension contribution in the form of a lump sum. A copy of the Letter of No Contest (refer to Annex V) and the calculation sheet must be provided to the SC holder and a copy kept on the file.   Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP)  Individuals engaged under SC who serve at, or travel at UNDP’s expense to, a designated hazardous duty station are automatically covered by the Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP) and must therefore be included under the safety and security measures implemented by the UNDP Country Office under the Security Plan. Failure to comply with security instructions may render the insurance coverage null and void in so far as it relates to the SC holder in question. Furthermore, non-compliance with security instructions is grounds for termination of the SC for cause. The UNDP Office must therefore ensure that the information on MAIP and the relevant security instructions are available to SC holders.   All claims, together with supporting documentation, must be submitted by the SC holder to the local Human Resources Administrator, who is responsible for reviewing such claims and forwarding them to the HR Advisor serving the duty station in Headquarters.   Medical Evacuation  Individuals engaged under SC are not eligible for medical evacuation unless they are on official travel status outside the duty station.  However, the UNDP office may facilitate the medical evacuation in cases of an emergency nature, where the local health services are inadequate and the SC holder requests the assistance of UNDP. The cost for such medical evacuation shall be facilitated at the full cost of the SC holder.  The SC holder must be provided with advance notice and agree in writing to pay the full cost of the medical evacuation.   Under the global Cigna International \"Group Life, Disability & Medical insurance plan, in the case of emergency or major disability the cost of special transportation of an insured SC holder from the first place where the SC holder is injured or stricken by a disease to the first hospital where treatment is given, is covered up to the ceiling established under this benefit.  If the SC holder is enrolled under the Cigna plan for medical coverage, the CO must inform Cigna International when a medical evacuation takes place to facilitate guidance and support.   Annual Leave  Annual leave will be accrued in accordance with the general local practice, except that in no case is the SC to provide for less than 1.5 days of paid leave per month (for example, 18 days per year if the SC is for a twelve-month period; if less than twelve months, the leave is pro-rated).    All annual leave must be taken within the period of the SC.  When the SC is extended for an additional period, it is possible that the SC may be allowed to carry an accumulated annual leave to a maximum of 18 days.   Unused vacation leave at the end of the SC cannot be commuted to cash.   Absence without Remuneration  SC is an engagement with UNDP for the time bound delivery of a specific project activity or service and it is against this principle that leave of absence with or without pay to take up another assignment is not permitted except for compelling family reasons, such as birth of a child, serious illness or death in the family.   Absence without Remuneration may be granted for a period of one-month or less in total during the term of the contract and is subject to exigency of services. In these particular cases, a SC holder must first exhaust all annual leave before leave of absence without remuneration is granted.   In the event that a SC holder is called upon to serve in the military forces of his country for training or active duty and is required to do so by national law, the Country Office should seek exemption of SC holders from such military service through a formal agreement with the national authorities. The objective for such exemption is to minimize the disruption of services under the SC and to avoid any conflict between the military obligations and the independent/impartial nature of the SC.  Should all attempts at reaching an agreement with the national authorities for such exemption fail, an exceptional waiver may be granted to allow for absence without remuneration for the duration of the military service. Requests for such waiver must be submitted to the through the respective HR Business Advisor at Headquarters.  During the period of absence without remuneration, the SC holder is solely responsible for continuing payment of the appropriate contributions for social security coverage, as UNDP’s obligation to make such payments is discontinued during this period.  Absence due to sickness  The SC holder is entitled to sick leave in accordance with the general local practice, except that in no case shall an SC provide for less than one day of sick leave per month at full pay (for example, 12 days per year if the SC is for a 12-month period; if less than 12 months, the leave is pro-rated).  A medical certificate must support any absence from work of more than three consecutive working days.  After three uncertified sick leave days in any 6 month period, medical certification is required for any medically related absence for the rest of the contract period.  In the event that an individual surpasses the sick leave limit in the contract period, the period in excess is to be charged against accrued annual leave. In case annual leave has been exhausted, the subsequent period of sick leave is unpaid.   Unused sick leave at the end of service is not commutable to cash at the end of the contract period, and cannot be carried over, in the event of an extension, if any.  Maternity Leave  Paid maternity leave is to be established taking into account the general local practice in the market, except that in no case shall the period of maternity leave be less than 16 continuous weeks, which is the minimum standard.  The maternity leave must fall within and be taken during the contract period.        Paternity Leave  Paid paternity leave must take into account the general local practice, except that in no case shall the paternity leave be less than four weeks, which is the minimum standard. The Paternity leave must fall within and be taken during the contract period.    The SC holder must have had at least 6 months of service with UNDP at the time of the birth of the child.  The leave is to be taken in one or two equal periods during the first twelve months from the birth of a child.    The paternity leave is limited to once a year, regardless of the number of children born during that year, and can only be availed at a maximum up to six times during the total engagement within the UN system.  Engagement of a Service Contract Holder  Terms of Reference  For development projects, the responsibility for preparing the terms of reference rests with the executing entity/implementing partner with support from the UNDP Office focal unit.  The terms of reference are incorporated into the SC, as an Annex.   For management projects in the UNDP Office, the terms of reference for SC are prepared by the Responsible Officer well before the contracting process to allow adequate time for advertising for professional levels. The terms of reference are the basis for the UNDP Office to measure compliance and overall results.  The terms of reference must clearly highlight the following:  Objectives and targets, as further detailed in the individual work plan;   Measurable outputs of the work assignment;  Reporting structure;  Performance Indicators for evaluation of results;  Skills and competencies expected of the individual;  Minimum qualifications and experience; and  Duration of the service.  An individual work plan must be established for the SC within one month of the contract signature, in line with the terms of reference.   The work plan must be reviewed as necessary by the supervisor and the SC holder during the term of the contract.  Selection by Competitive Process   UNDP Offices must comply with UNDP standards for a transparent and competitive selection process in accordance with the Guiding Principles listed in the Recruitment and Selection Framework Policy to ensure that the person selected is the best-qualified candidate to perform the job functions in a fully satisfactory manner, unless waived by the Bureau Director under sub-paragraph (c), below.   The engagement process for SCs should follow these steps:   The Office must prepare Terms of Reference (TORs) and advertise the position. The vacancy should be posted on the UNDP job website.  Depending on the degree of knowledge and skills required, local media advertising is recommended, with due regard to the cost/benefit issue if it is envisaged that it will produce the calibre of candidate needed.  For positions in the SB5 Band, it is also recommended that international organizations and NGOs are informed of the vacancy as this might facilitate reaching potential candidates.  The requisite academic qualifications for this level must include a postgraduate degree and years of relevant experience commensurate with the job.   The UNDP Office must establish an ad hoc panel for the purpose of selecting the best-qualified candidate. A minimum of two candidates must be assessed to ensure a competitive and transparent process. . In exceptional cases, the Office may interview only one candidate after the competitive process only one candidate meets the requirements, provided that the Office documents the efforts made to identify other qualified candidates, including re-advertisement. The selection process must ensure that due regard is given to achieving an equitable balance in terms of gender and diversity appropriate for the location. The Panel provides its recommendation to the Resident Representative for a final decision.   UNDP Offices may also use a roster of pre - assessed candidates, in accordance with locally established roster procedures. The selection process through the roster process remains subject to the approval of the Resident Representative.   See Annex VII –  Roster procedures.  UNDP Offices may also transfer an individual SC holder from one project to another in the same duty station with similar functions and the same level of remuneration, without having to re-advertise the vacancy and go through a new competitive process, provided that the candidate has a satisfactory service evaluation record. In such instances a new service contract must be issued.   The Bureau Director is authorized to grant a waiver of competitive recruitment for up to 20 Service Contracts (SC) per annum, per country office, however:  The process must ensure that the person selected is the best-qualified candidate to perform the functions in a fully satisfactory manner;  References must be checked prior to issuing the service contract;  Contracting of close family relatives and other conflict of interest matters must be verified prior to issuing the service contract;  The individuals must be medically cleared and enrolled in the applicable medical and life insurance policy prior to issuing the service contract;  The service contract issued must be in compliance with the standard terms and conditions;   The individuals must be informed of the contract terms and standards of conduct as set out in the POPP and the contract template; and  The SC modality must be used for its proper purpose as set out in the existing policies and guidelines.   Reference Checks  UNDP Offices must require written independent references to verify the credentials and experience of the candidate and substantiate them prior to the issuance of an offer of contract.   Requesting offices, with support from the UNDP HR Unit, are responsible for conducting reference checks and documenting findings before submitting for issuance of a contract.    Candidates that apply for vacancies under a Service Contract must complete the modified format of the P-11 form to facilitate reference checks with previous employers.  Engagement of former staff members in receipt of a UN pension  Former staff members in receipt of a  UN pension benefit , may be engaged under SC, only if:  The engagement represents both a cost-effective and operationally sound solution to meet the needs of the service;   Records show that a competitive process was carried out;   The break in service requirement is met;   The former staff member in receipt of a UN pension benefit  was not separated on grounds of disciplinary action or unsatisfactory performance; and  Provided the individual is medically cleared.  The Responsible Officer must ensure that the remuneration of a UNDP (or UN and its funds and programmes) retiree does not exceed the limits set for those receiving a UNJSPF pension benefit, currently set at USD50,000 per calendar year.  Engagement of former staff in receipt of a UNJSPF pension benefit must not exceed the duration of 6 months in one calendar year and are non-renewable.  Contracting Close Relatives of UNDP Staff Members  The spouse of a UNDP Staff Member or an individual engaged on a Service Contract may be engaged under SC, provided they are in no direct supervision of each other.    Contracting close relatives of UNDP staff members or an individual engaged on a Service Contract (father, mother, brother, son, daughter, brother or sister) must follow the conditions stipulated in the Policy on Family Relationship.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Responsible Officer must at all times ensure adherence to the requirements in the Staff Regulations and Rules relating to conflict of interest (refer to Staff Regulations and Rules 1.2 g m).  Medical Clearance  A medical examination, consistent with the requirements of the UN Medical Service, must be cleared by the UN Examining Physician or other recognized physician, before any UNDP contract offer is made. The cost of the medical examination should be charged to the same source of funding as the SC itself.    The medical clearance should be placed in the relevant file of the SC holder and it may be required at a later date in the case of a claim for disability or injury.    A new  medical examination is required every two years for SC holders performing security functions, driving services and manual work, if extended.  SC holders may be required, at any time, to undergo a medical examination when requested to do so to protect the health and safety of SC holders and UN personnel, to follow-up chronic health conditions, or to assess how new or a change in health circumstances since a prior clearance might affect an SC holder’s capability to fulfill the functions for which they were contracted.  Contract Duration  Usually a SC is issued for a minimum period of 6 months, renewable, but not more than 12 months at a time.  In the case of project personnel, the maximum period for the use of a SC is normally for the duration of the project.    Generally, services expected to be completed in less than 6 months should be contracted under the IC modality.  SCs are not intended to be of an indefinite duration. It must be recalled that in the UNDP Office SCs are used for work that could be outsourced and therefore the need for the services must be annually reviewed and documented at the time of renewing the SC.   All SC holders must be clearly notified at the outset, and then reminded upon renewal, if any, that there is no assurance of continued engagement and that the SC will be reviewed from year to year, on the basis of need for the service, availability of funds and the quality of performance.  Exceptional situations where contract duration may be less than 6 months  There may be certain situations, such as contracting for emergency operations, e.g. Tsunami Emergency Relief, or management and development projects, where issues of funding or uncertainty of duration, might make it difficult to issue an initial SC for 6 months or more. In such cases, and where the contract is expected to be extended, a SC of less than 6 months may be issued at the outset. This will avoid the need to switch the type of contract from IC to SC, after an initial short period.   In accordance with their delegation of authority, this exception may be approved by the Resident Representative, prior to issuance of the SC. The Regional Bureau and the respective HR Business Advisors are to ensure proper oversight and monitoring.  Part-time work   Some of the functions and activities appropriate to the SC modality can be performed on a part-time basis. The basic principle for establishing the pay for part-time remuneration is that of pro-rating the pay from full-time pay for comparable work. For example, if a SC holder is engaged to work a four-day week (with normal working hours) the pay would be set at 80% of the pay for a SC with the same terms of reference on full-time basis. Similarly, any other elements in the pay package (e.g. the organization’s portion of the subsidy for health insurance; group life and disability insurance etc. will be 80%) are to be pro-rated in the same manner. In the case of the danger allowance which is granted in recognition of the requirement to report to work under dangerous conditions and not necessarily the duration of the work day, the full amount is paid.   The precise working arrangements of the part-time work must be clearly specified in the contract and understood by the SC and the immediate supervisor. Any change to the hours of work and pay must first be made by a contract amendment.  Service Quality Management  Training and Development  During the term of the SC, the UNDP Office may determine that a SC holder requires additional training and development in connection with the services. In all cases, such training and development shall be authorized in the interests of UNDP. Proposals for training of SC holders are submitted to the Resident Representative for approval through the Supervisor.   Service Evaluation  Service monitoring and evaluation are mandatory and a regular management responsibility that are carried out as part of a process to provide regular feedback about individual performance and progress achieved against agreed terms of reference. Performance of the SC holder must be monitored and documented throughout the duration of the SC.  In this context, the purpose of the Service Evaluation is to:  Review progress against agreed upon terms of reference and detailed work plan;  Provide feedback on the overall performance of the individual SC holder; and  Make informed decisions on contractual matters (extension, non-renewal).  A SC Service Evaluation form is provided in Annex II or in UNALL.  The SC Evaluation must be completed by the supervisor prior to contract expiration, ideally one month prior to expiry, after:  Receiving a short written self-assessment by the SC holder including special accomplishments (to be attached to the Evaluation form); and  Holding a Service Evaluation session with the individual SC holder with a view to discuss performance.  The Service Evaluation must indicate satisfaction with service performance during the contract period including, as applicable, any mention of service provided above or below expected standards or in addition to those activities established in the TOR. Each Service Evaluation must specify whether the SC will be extended beyond the current duration.   The Service Evaluation must indicate if a Performance Bonus is recommended, in accordance with the criteria laid down under the section applicable to Performance Bonuses.  The Service Evaluation of SC holders must always be completed before the expiry of the SC, ideally one month prior to expiry.  For periods of service of less than twelve months, the service evaluation may be documented as a note to file. One full service evaluation report must be completed for any twelve month period.  Each Service Evaluation form must be filed for record keeping in the personal file by the human resources unit in the country office or online when available.  Contract Extension and Termination  Contract Extension   If a decision is taken to extend a SC, a brief review is made to see if the terms of reference are still valid or need to be modified. More often than not there will be little or no change in the terms of reference (TOR) for lower level SC holders since many of these contract holders will be providing basic services such as cleaner, gardeners, messenger work or driving. However, for contract holders at higher levels, a careful review of the TOR must be carried out. The UNDP Office should indicate under section VII of the Service Evaluation form why there is a continuing need for the activities that justify an extension of the SC.    After the first service evaluation, a SC can be renewed for periods up to 12 months at a time, in line with funds availability and suitability of performance, based on the Service Evaluation form.  All contract extensions must be submitted prior to the expiration of the contract.  Expiration of Contract  In the event that a SC will not be renewed upon expiry, an advance  formal notice  issued to the SC holder at least one month before the contract expires, keeping in mind that in all cases the minimum number of days of notice under the contract must be provided for termination as set forth below and in the contract itself:  The advance notice should allow the SC holder, to use up any accumulated annual leave, keeping in mind that unused leave is not commutable to cash; and  The Responsible Officer must inform the operational units (HR/Finance/IT) in writing of expiration of a SC in order that necessary actions are taken, e.g. recovery of any indebtedness to the organization, return of UNDP, property such as computers/laptops, building access ID cards, keys, badges, etc. and release of final pay.  A copy of the notification must be placed in the individual's personnel file.  UNDP Offices must ensure that the individual is administratively terminated from participation in social security schemes, arranged and paid for by UNDP that might be in effect. When an individual chooses to continue in a local scheme after termination, it is the responsibility of that individual to make the arrangements for continuation and payment of the entire premium.  The UNDP Office may provide a letter of reference upon request.  Where an SC holder has violated the standards of conduct or other material terms of the contract, including acts fraud or misrepresentation, the contract must be terminated and, not let to expire.  Termination of Contract Prior to expiry  Either party may terminate the SC before the expiry date of the contract by giving notice in writing to the other party.  The minimum period of notice shall be 14 calendar days.   In the event that the contract is foreshortened by UNDP, where circumstances do not allow for the required period of notice, the SC holder will be entitled to compensation, equivalent to one-week gross remuneration for each month of uncompleted service.    If such termination is a result of violation of the standards of conduct or other material terms of the contract, the individual will not be entitled to either a period of notice or other compensation. In the event that the termination results from a violation of the standards of conduct, such individuals will not be eligible for any future service contract.   No compensation shall be made in the event that the SC holder terminates the contract.  The UNDP Office must terminate the Service Contract in the following circumstances:  abandonment of functions, i.e., when the SC holder is absent from duty without prior approval for more than five consecutive days;  violation of the standards of conduct or other material terms of the contract in the SC, including acts fraud or misrepresentation;  unsatisfactory performance documented in the Service Evaluation  form or otherwise; and  other extenuating circumstances as deemed appropriate by the UNDP office management.  Recourse/Settlement of disputes  In the event of any dispute arising out of the SC, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the dispute settlement clause in the contract.  It is essential that country offices seek the advice of the Legal Office in complex cases involving issues of breach of contract relating to misconduct.   If a settlement cannot be achieved through internal discussions and should arbitration be needed, the case must be referred promptly to OHR Policy Unit and the Legal Office, with all supporting documentation.    As part of their orientation, SC holders must be advised that they can report:  allegations of  workplace harassment, sexual harassment and abuse authority, should be channeled through the following email address: harassment.support@undp.Organization; or  Allegations of fraud or mismanagement of funds should be channeled through the following email address: hotline@UNDP.org.  Such allegations must be reported in good faith and with substantiating and detailed information and documentation.  Roles and Responsibilities  Resident Representatives   Resident Representatives are responsible for enforcing the terms of this User Guide and accountable for decisions taken including those of the Responsible Officers or other individuals delegated authority hereunder. Regional Bureau Directors must consider the performance of the Resident Representatives in managing the SC in accordance with this User Guide in the annual performance review of Resident Representatives e.g. Audit Reports and OHR reports may be used as a reference for evaluation.

    "settling-grant": "Settling In Grant  The purpose of the settling-in grant is to provide eligible staff members reasonable financial support for relocation on initial appointment or reassignment to a new duty station. It is the total compensation payable by the Organization towards costs incurred by the eligible staff member and his or her family members as a result of an appointment or reassignment involving relocation, as well as any pre-departure expenses that the staff member may incur as a result.   The settling-in grant enters into force on 1 July 2016, and replaces the former Assignment Grant which is discontinued as of that date.  Elements of the Grant  The grant consists of two elements:  a Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) portion  a lump-sum portion  Eligibility  Internationally recruited staff members are eligible for the settling-in grant, subject to meeting the specific requirements set out in this policy.  An eligible staff member is entitled to payment of the grant when he or she has been authorized to travel involving relocation on initial appointment or reassignment to a new duty station. To qualify, a move must be beyond commuting distance from place of recruitment (for initial appointment), or previous duty station (for existing staff), and must involve a change of accommodation. In this regard, international and within-country moves, from one duty station to another, are treated equally.  The grant is not paid to a staff member recruited from the area within commuting distance of the duty station unless he or she demonstrates that it was necessary to change accommodation as a direct consequence of the appointment with UNDP, for instance after moving out of a house formerly provided free of charge by his or her previous employer. Other accommodation changes within the area of commuting distance, and promotion or recruitment to the Professional category of a staff member previously serving in another category at the same duty station, shall not give rise to payment of the grant.    Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) portion  The DSA portion consists of a period of subsistence allowance at the rate of the new duty station at the date of payment, and is paid in US dollars.  In respect of the staff member:  30 days of DSA  In respect of eligible family members:  15 days’ of DSA for each eligible family member for whom travel expenses to the same duty station have been paid by UNDP, provided that the family arrives at the duty station at least six months prior to the date the staff member’s service at the duty station is due to end (although this requirement may be waived in respect of dependent children attending an educational institution outside the duty station and for whom boarding fees are paid).  In cases when the assignment to a new duty station is for less than one year, the DSA portion of the grant shall nevertheless be paid in full.  Lump Sum Portion  A staff member who is appointed or reassigned to a duty station for one year or longer shall receive a lump-sum payment of one month’s net base salary plus, post adjustment at the duty station of assignment.  In cases where the assignment is for less than a year, a staff member shall be paid only the daily subsistence allowance portion of the settling in grant assignment grant, Should the appointment or assignment subsequently be extended to one year or longer at the same duty station, the staff member shall receive the balance of the settling-in grant i.e. the lump-sum portion.  When both spouses are UN staff members  When a staff member is married to another staff member or to a staff member of another organization of the United Nations common system and each spouse travels on appointment or reassignment at the expense of the Organization to the same duty station: Each staff member shall receive the DSA portion of the grant for himself or herself;  The DSA portion in respect of dependent children travelling to the duty station shall be paid to the staff member on whom they are recognized as being dependent; Only one lump sum shall be paid, normally to the higher graded spouse and on the basis of his or her emoluments.  When both spouses travel on appointment or reassignment at the expense of the Organization to different duty stations:  Each staff member shall receive the DSA portion of the grant for himself or herself;  The DSA portion in respect of dependent children travelling to one of the duty stations where their parents are assigned shall normally be paid to the parent on whom they are recognized as being dependent, unless the child accompanies the other parent and both staff members request that the DSA portion be paid to that other parent;  Each staff member shall receive the lump-sum portion applicable to his or her situation.  Advances against the lump sum and DSA portion  An advance of 100 per cent of the lump-sum portion of the grant, as computed at the time the advance payment is made, may be paid up to three months in advance of travel of a staff member assigned or transferred to a new duty station.  No advance against the lump-sum portion may be made in the case of initial appointments.  Pursuant to UN Staff Rule 7.10, staff members shall receive an appropriate daily subsistence allowance for periods of duty away from their official duty station, provided that such period does not exceed the maximum duration of six months under UN Staff Rule 4.8. Any extension of such assignment, in accordance with UN Staff Rule 4.8, shall result in a change of duty station and payment of the post adjustment and related entitlements, notwithstanding UN Staff Rule 3.7 (c). The change in duty station may also result in the payment of a settling-in grant (both DSA and lump-sum portion, where applicable), provided the following conditions are met:  The total expected period of service at the duty station, including the period during which the staff received the subsistence allowance, is at least 12 months;  The extension occurs at least six months prior to the expected end of the appointment or assignment at the duty station.  However, when subsistence allowance has been paid for a period not exceeding the maximum duration under UN Staff Rule 4.8, and the assignment is extended to reach a total period of 12 months, including the period during which the staff received the subsistence allowance, the staff member is not entitled to the DSA portion of the grant. Only the lump-sum portion of the grant shall be paid.  Reduction in period of service at the duty station  The DSA portion of the grant paid on arrival at the duty station shall normally not be recoverable.  When the staff member has not completed the period of service at the duty station in respect of which the lump-sum portion of the settling-in grant has been paid, the lump-sum portion of the grant shall normally be prorated and recovered or adjusted in the proportion that the period of service at the duty station bears to one year. However, UNDP may grant an exception for compelling and/or compassionate reasons (e.g., health, reduction of the duration of an appointment or assignment at the direction of the Organization, i.e., due to closure or restructuring of a department/office, or for other reasons beyond the control of the staff member). In such instances there shall be no prorating of any portion of the grant.   Transitional measure  Staff members assigned to field duty stations prior to 1 July 2016, will still be eligible to receive their second one month’s salary lump sum upon expectation that they will complete a third year at their field duty station of their current assignment.   ",
    "sick-leave": "Sick Leave    General Provisions    Staff members who are unable to perform their duties due to illness or injury, or whose attendance is prevented by public health requirements, may be granted sick leave under United Nations Staff Rule 6.2 and in accordance with the provisions of this policy document.     For sick leave specifically related to injury or illness that is considered to be attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of UNDP, in addition to the relevant provision of this policy document, Appendix D of the UN Staff Rules applies.    Staff members are responsible for informing their supervisors and HR focal points/leave monitors promptly of absence due to injury or illness to enable timely entry into the HR e-Services module.    Certified sick leave will be granted only on the basis of a medical certificate or report from a medical practitioner licensed to practice where the certificate or report is issued, except in cases of uncertified sick leave as detailed in paragraphs 6 and 7.    Entitlement    5.   Staff members are entitled to sick leave, inclusive of certified and uncertified sick leave as described below and in accordance with UN Staff Rule 6.2:    Staff members holding a temporary appointment shall be granted sick leave at the rate of two working days per month of contractual service, the total of which is computed and credited upon appointment of the staff member based on their appointment duration.    Staff members holding fixed-term appointment with less than three years of continuous service shall be granted sick leave up to 65 working days on full salary and 65 working days on half salary in any period of 12 consecutive months. Three months are equivalent to 65 working days.    Staff members holding a permanent or continuing appointment or who have completed three or more years of continuous service on a fixed-term appointment shall be granted sick leave up to 195 working days on full salary and 195 working days on half salary in any period of 48 consecutive months. Nine months are equivalent to 195 working days.    Uncertified Sick Leave    Uncertified sick leave may be used when staff members are unable to perform their official duties due to illness or injury or for reasons of family-related emergencies. Staff members may take sick leave, inclusive of uncertified illness or family emergencies, without producing a medical certificate for a consecutive or cumulative maximum of seven working days in an annual cycle starting 1 April of the current year and ending 31 March of the following year. Any balance of un-used uncertified sick leave cannot be carried over from one annual cycle to the next.    Uncertified sick leave, including days used for family-related emergencies, is part of the total sick leave entitlement as detailed in paragraph 5.    Certified Sick Leave    Absence from work for more than seven consecutive working days must be supported by a medical certificate or a medical report issued by a duly qualified medical practitioner to the effect that the staff members are unable to perform their duties by reason of illness or injury. The medical certificate must indicate the date or dates of absence from duty by reason of illness, injury or incapacitation, without identification of diagnosis. The medical certificate or report must be submitted by the staff member by uploading it in the HR e-Services module no later than 20 days following the first day of the sick leave.    A medical certificate or medical report from a duly qualified practitioner is not required under the following circumstances:    For a period of absence owing to illness or injury that has already been certified by the UN Medical Director or designated medical officer at the duty station in the form of a ‘sent home’ slip;    For a period of absence of up to half a day owing to a visit to a licensed medical practitioner, upon submission of a certified note from the doctor indicating that the staff member consulted the doctor or dentist.    Sick leave up to 20 working days taken cumulatively or consecutively during a 12-month period is approved by the staff member’s supervisor, upon presentation by the staff member of medical certificates, medical reports, ‘sent home’ slips or confirmation of medical appointment/consultation letters.    For sick leave beyond 20 working days, the staff member must submit the required medical certificate, the MS 24 form and medical report directly to the United Nations Division of Health-Care Management and Occupational Safety and Health (UN DHMOSH) or designated medical officer for certification as soon as possible and not later than the 20th working day following the initial absence from duty/ the office.    Where a medical certificate or report is not submitted as per paragraphs 8 and 10 or if the sick leave is not certified by the UN Medical Director or designated medical officer, the absence shall be treated for administrative purposes as unauthorized absence in accordance with UN Staff Rule 5.3 (c) (ii).     Late submissions of the required medical certificate or report as well as determination by the Administrator or designated representative that the late submission was attributable to circumstances beyond the staff member’s control, e.g., medical condition, will result in the absence being charged to sick leave upon certification by the UN Medical Director or designated medical officer.    Staff members on sick leave may be required, at any time, to submit a medical certificate in respect to their condition or to undergo examination by a medical practitioner designated by UN DHMOSH.     Sick leave may be refused or the unused portion withdrawn if it is determined by UN DHMOSH that the staff member is able to return to work or if the staff member does not attend a medical examination when required to do so. The staff member is entitled to seek a review of the matter, in which case it is referred to another medical practitioner or to a medical board acceptable to both the United Nations Medical Director and the staff member in accordance with UN Staff Rule 6.7 (a).    Staff members on sick leave who need to leave their duty station must, prior to departing, provide confirmation from their medical practitioner that they are fit to travel, and their contact address to the designated Human Resources/Operations focal point at the duty station.     Authorized absences due to an injury or illness attributable to service shall be charged to the sick leave of the staff member. For this purpose, the staff member may be granted a special sick leave credit equal to the authorized service-incurred sick leave in accordance with and subject to Appendix D to the UN Staff Rules.    Sick Leave on Half Pay and Combination with Annual Leave or Part-time Work (Half Duty)    When staff members have exhausted all of their entitlement to sick leave on full pay, further sick leave will be charged to the sick leave on half-pay entitlement as per paragraphs 5 (b) and (c) until the entitlement to sick leave on full pay arises again after the four-year period for the initial entitlement.    Staff members on sick leave with half pay may elect to maintain their full-pay status by supplementing their half-pay sick leave with any accrued annual leave until such annual leave is exhausted.     When staff members on sick leave are medically cleared by UN DHMOSH to return to duty on a half-time basis, they will remain on full-pay status by using their sick leave at half-pay entitlement. (Refer to ‘Part-time Employment’ under Flexible Work Arrangements)     Extension of Fixed-term and Temporary Appointments for Use of Sick Leave Entitlement    When staff members on a fixed-term or temporary appointment are incapacitated for service by reason of an illness that continues beyond the date of expiration of the appointment, they shall be granted an extension of their appointment, after consultation with the United Nations Medical Director or designated medical officer, for the continuous period of certified illness up to the maximum entitlement to sick leave at full pay, and in the case of fixed-term appointments at half pay as per paragraphs 5 (b) and (c).    When staff members’ fixed-term or temporary appointments are extended solely to enable them to use their sick leave entitlement, the following applies:  No further entitlement to salary increment, annual leave, sick leave, parental leave or home leave;  Continued accrual of service credit towards repatriation grant if the staff members have not returned to their home country; and   Continued accrual of service credit towards death benefit in the event of death during the period of extension.     Sick leave on half pay during the period of extension may not be supplemented by annual leave, i.e., the provisions in paragraph 19 do not apply when the staff members’ appointments are extended solely to enable them to use their sick leave entitlement. In the event of death of the staff member, the period prior to the death may be taken into account in the determination of the death benefit provided in UN Staff Rule 9.9 (a).    Before Exhaustion of Sick Leave Entitlement    24. In cases where staff members are approaching exhaustion of  their entitlement to sick leave with full pay, the designated HR focal point must bring the situation to the attention of OHR, which will contact the United Nations Medical Director in order to determine whether those staff members should be considered for a disability benefit under article 33 (a) of the Regulations, Rules and Pension Adjustment System of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF) while they are is on sick leave with half pay. UN DHMOSH, via OHR, shall periodically contact offices with instructions for the submission of cases for consideration for disability benefit.  (Refer to Termination of Appointment for Reasons of Health)  Exhaustion of Sick Leave Entitlement    When the entitlement to sick leave has been exhausted, further absences due to illness or injury shall be charged to any annual leave that the staff member may have accrued. When the entitlements to sick leave and annual leave have been fully exhausted, the staff member may be placed on special leave without pay, subject to approval by the Director, Office of Human Resources (OHR).    When the staff member is being considered for a disability benefit and all paid leave (i.e., sick leave and annual leave) entitlements have been exhausted because of a delay in the medical determination of the staff member’s incapacity for further service or in the decision by the United Nations Staff Pension Committee whether to award a disability benefit, the staff member will be placed on special leave with half pay until the date of such a decision. This provision does not apply if the staff member does not pursue consideration for the UN disability benefit.    Effect of Sick Leave on other Entitlements     A staff member shall continue to accrue annual leave while on sick leave with full-pay status, while absent from work under an agreed arrangement combining a half day of annual leave with a full day of sick leave at half pay, and while absent from work under an officially agreed arrangement whereby half-time duty is combined with a full day of sick leave at half pay, in accordance with UN Staff Rule 5.3 (a) and (b).     The accrual of annual leave is subject to the staff members being in full-pay status and therefore no annual leave will accrue during periods of sick leave at half pay, except when the staff members request to combine each day of sick leave at half pay with one half day’s annual leave to maintain their full pay status as per paragraph 19.     Periods of sick leave, whether on full or half pay, except for situations described in paragraphs 22 and 23 shall not affect the accrual of service credits, where applicable, towards salary increment, home leave, termination indemnity and repatriation grant. Sick leave on full pay or half pay does not affect participation in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund. The staff member’s and UNDP’s contributions remain the same (i.e., full contribution) during sick leave with half pay.    Staff members who are on sick leave with half pay after exhausting their sick leave on full pay and who cannot be maintained on full-pay status through a combination of sick leave on half pay with accrued annual leave or half-time duty, shall receive:   \t  Half of their base salary and post adjustment, where applicable;    The full amount of the following allowances and benefits: dependency allowance, language allowance, education grant, mobility and hardship allowance, rental subsidy and health insurance subsidy, as applicable, depending on the staff member’s type of appointment. Individual allowances and benefits linked to the performance of functions under defined circumstances, as is the case for special post allowance, salary differential or night differential, shall not be payable.     Sick Leave during Periods of Annual Leave and Parental Leave   \t  Any illness during annual leave, including home leave, family visit and reverse education grant travel, may be approved as certified sick leave if such illness is certified in accordance with paragraphs 10 and 11. The days of absence due to illness reported immediately preceding or following a period of annual leave authorized in advance are treated separately as sick leave (uncertified or certified) in the normal way.    No sick leave will be granted during paid parental leave, except when serious (life-threatening) complications arise during the prenatal and postnatal leave of birth parents as determined by UN DHMOSH and in line with UN Staff Rule 6.3 (d). If, on expiration of parental leave, a staff member is unable to return to duty because of illness, such absence will be charged to sick leave upon presentation of a medical certificate in accordance with paragraphs 10 and 11.    Sick Leave and Inability to Perform Duties Related to Public Health Crises    In cases of a public health crisis, as declared the WHO, which may affect a staff member through contact with a suspected or confirmed medical case, staff and their family members must immediately notify UN DHMOSH or the designated medical officer at the duty station. Staff members should not report to duty.    When offices are open, staff members who are unable to perform their functions:  by reason of illness related to the public health crises, will be granted certified sick leave; or   by reasons of quarantine at the direction of UN DHMOSH will be granted Special Leave with Full Pay (SLWFP).      When offices are closed, staff members who are on sick leave at the time the offices are closed, will be placed on SLWFP as from the day they were expected to report for duty following exhaustion of their approved certified/uncertified sick leave.     The above provisions on public health crises may be amended and superseded, as appropriate, by administrative guidelines issued at the direction of United Nations Medical Director. ",
    "special-leave": "Special Leave  This policy implements UN Staff Regulation 5.2 and UN Staff Rule 5.3  Purpose  This policy establishes the circumstances under which staff members may apply for special leave of absence from work, particularly for extended periods, which are not covered by the UNDP policies for annual leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, adoption, surrogacy leave or sick leave.  This policy does not cover inter-agency exchanges within the UN system, loans, secondments, mission assignments to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations or internal movements within UNDP under different contractual modalities, which are governed by separate policies.   Eligibility  As a general rule, UNDP staff members holding Permanent Appointments (PAs), or Fixed-Term Appointments (FTAs) under the UN Staff Rules are eligible to apply for special leave for the reasons outlined below.  Staff members holding Temporary Appointments (TAs) are normally not eligible for special leave without Pay (SLWOP).  However, they may be exceptionally granted limited periods of SLWOP, for compelling emergency reasons, under specific conditions described in paragraph 12.  Applicability  Special leave is normally without pay except in limited circumstances. For the reasons set out in paragraph 9, the Administrator or their delegate may approve special leave with full pay (SLWFP) or special leave with partial pay (SLWPP) to staff members holding PAs or FTAs under the UN Staff Rules.  In accordance with Staff Rule 5.3 (b), special leave (with or without pay) shall not be allowed for governmental service in a political office, in a diplomatic or other representational post or for the purpose of performing any functions that are incompatible with the staff member’s status as an international civil servant (e.g. running for elected, political office), in which case the staff member is required to resign from UNDP. SLWOP cannot and will not be granted while waiting for the outcome of an election or a political nomination.   While on special leave, even without pay, a staff member retains their status as a UNDP staff member and as such is still bound by the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules of the United Nations, the UN Standards of Conduct and other applicable policies and administrative issuances.  Staff members are normally expected to return to active duty after completing the period of special leave. Rationale  Reasons for special leave with full or with partial pay  Special leave with full or partial pay may be authorized for:  Cases of extended illness (after all sick leave entitlements have been exhausted and pending determination of the award of disability benefits by the Pension Fund Committee);  Other compelling reasons, determined by the Director, Office of Human Resources (OHR), such as extreme conditions of national security or a life-threatening situation;  Civil service, jury duty and appearance in court as a witness;  Study leave at the expense of the Organization — for example, sabbatical leave; and  The Administrator may, in exceptional cases, place a staff member on SLWFP if the Administrator considers such leave to be in the interest of the Organization.  The policy on special leave provides assistance to staff members in balancing their working life with personal responsibilities, needs and interests. UNDP aims to create a well-managed flexible working environment that supports staff members, promotes well-being and maintains fair and effective working practices, thereby providing a balance between organizational priorities and personal life. While staff members do not have an entitlement to special leave, UNDP will review requests for such leave in light of individual needs and organizational circumstances.  Reasons for Special leave without pay  SLWOP may be authorized for the following reasons:  To accompany a spouse or legally recognized partner who has been assigned for their work to a different location;  To allow more time for a parent to take care of their child following parental leave (maternity, paternity, adoption or surrogacy);  For academic studies at the expense of staff members;   When staff members are reinstated into a PA or FTA, in cases when any period between separation and re-employment cannot be covered by accrued annual leave;  For military service (in accordance with Appendix C of the UN Staff Rules);  For other compelling/personal reasons, such as serious illness of family members, time off after returning from a non-family duty station;  To carry out a technical assignment with a governmental, non-governmental or private institution in the interest of the Organization;  For search purposes when on unassigned status for a maximum duration of one year;  For pension purposes to protect the pension benefits of staff members who are within two years of reaching 55 years of age or who are above that age and within two years of important Pension Fund thresholds (i.e. 25 or 30 years of contributory service);  For staff members implementing agreed separation. SLWOP may be used for bridging to important pension fund or medical insurance thresholds;   For locally recruited staff members to carry out an international assignment as United Nations Volunteers (UNV) within the UN system.  Staff members holding TAs are normally not eligible for any type of special leave. Special leave implies a sustained period of non-active service, which is inconsistent with the principle of TAs. However, under compelling circumstances such as medical emergencies, death of immediate family members or adoption of a child, special leave may be requested. Hiring managers should consult OHR on the duration and applicability. In general, requests for SLWOP for staff members holding TAs should not exceed brief periods of up to two weeks within a particular assignment, and under no circumstances may it be approved to extend a contract beyond its expiration date.  SLWOP is not the appropriate administrative status to cover periods of a staff member’s absence on detail assignment, secondment, loan, inter-agency exchange or transfer to another UN agency or movements within UNDP; therefore, SLWOP is not to be granted for that purpose. The administrative status of staff members on detail assignment and inter-agency movements falls under separate policies.   As required by UN Staff Regulation 1.2 (o), “Staff members shall not engage in any outside occupation or employment, whether remunerated or not, without the approval of the Secretary-General”, and Staff Regulation 1.2 (p) specifies the circumstances under which such approval may be granted.    A request for outside employment/activity is first submitted to the Director, Ethics. If recommended by the Director, Ethics, the request must be submitted to the Director, OHR or the designate, for final determination and approval. Failure to secure a prior authorization before starting an outside activity/employment will result in separation from UNDP for implicit resignation.  By requesting SLWOP from UNDP but at the same time beginning an employment elsewhere, a staff member implicitly demonstrates their unwillingness to work for UNDP.  Approval to undertake an outside employment/activity whilst on SLWOP will normally not be granted, unless the experience acquired through the outside employment/activity is beneficial to the Organization when the staff member returns to active service with UNDP.  In all other cases, SLWOP for employment outside the UN Common System will only be authorised, if it is deemed necessary for purposes of supporting a UNDP spouse or legally recognized partner who has been assigned for their work to a different location.    During the period of SLWOP the staff member may take up a temporary assignment within the UN Common System in order to gain experience and remain active. Any such outside activities while on special leave of any type, including an employment/activity within the UN system must be approved in advance.   A staff member cannot have a dual contractual status, therefore a staff member on SLWOP shall not be granted a TA, IC or SC within UNDP or any UN agency while on SLWOP, except as provided in paragraph 11 (k). A staff member that wishes to take up an activity within UNDP or any UN agency whilst on SLWOP, must revert back to active status. If this entails an assignment within UNDP that is outside of the staff member’s official duty station, such short-term activity may be considered as a detail or temporary assignment, depending on the nature and duration of the function. If the employment/activity is with another UN agency, it is administered under the inter-organization agreement e.g. as a reimbursable loan. In this case, the staff member’s status is changed from SLWOP to active status.   SLWOP for outside activities or a temporary assignment with another UN Agency will not be authorized for staff members holding a TA.   For staff members who have compelling personal reasons for not being physically present at the office but are still able and interested in continuing to work, other arrangements than special leave may be explored, such as telecommuting for a limited period of time or part-time employment. Conditions and duration  Special leave of any type for staff members holding a PA or FTA may be requested for a specific period of time, up to a maximum of 12 months.   Extensions beyond 12 months will be reviewed and may be approved, on an exceptional basis, for a maximum period of an additional 12 months. The total period on SLWOP shall not, in any event, exceed 24 months, except where SWLOP is granted purposes of supporting a UNDP spouse or legally recognized partner who has been assigned for their work to a different location, in which case it shall not exceed 60 months.   SLWOP is normally only granted up to the expiration date of the staff member’s appointment.   A staff member returning to active service from SLWOP is expected to complete at a minimum one full tour of duty or five years of continuous service before applying for another period of SLWOP. However, for highly compelling and personal reasons a second period of compassionate SLWOP may be exceptionally considered within the five-year period.  SLWOP is granted for a specific reason; if the initial reason changes during the course of the approved SLWOP, the staff member is obliged to submit a new request to the approving authority for reconsideration, in particular if outside activities are considered (see paragraphs 14 and 15).  Approval of special leave of any type depends on the nature of the request, operational necessity, availability of resources and replacements, and the interests of the Organization. For staff members holding UNDP letters of appointment for service limited to another organization, agency, fund or programme and administered by UNDP on behalf of such an organization, agency, fund or programme, any requests for special leave (with or without pay) must be reviewed in consultation with the respective organization. Structure Element - Relevant Policies Special leave and liens against posts SLWFP or SLWPP is granted with a specific lien on the post the staff member held prior to going on special leave.   A locally recruited staff member is normally granted special leave against a specific post, usually the post the staff member held prior to going on special leave, for a period up to one year. A lien against a specific post can be exceptionally extended for a maximum period of two years subject to approval of the Resident Representative or the Head of Office. Only in exceptional cases will special leave be granted on a general lien basis without the identification of a specific post for the staff member when they resume active duty. Positions held by a staff member on special leave may be temporarily filled by an appropriate staff contract, such as a TA, or, for staff members already holding a PA or FTA, a detail assignment for career enhancement (excluding ICs or SCs) for the duration of the special leave period.   Internationally recruited staff members holding a PA or FTA: Special leave of less than six months will normally be granted against a specific post. For SLWOP over six months, whenever possible, an internationally recruited staff member will be granted special leave against a specific post, usually the post the staff member held before the leave. However, when it is not possible to reserve a specific post for a staff member who would like to use special leave, approval of special leave may be granted on a general lien basis without the identification of a specific post for the staff member when they resume active duty.  If a lien is granted to a staff member holding an FTA limited to a specific post/project, the lien is against the post that the staff member encumbers.  If a specific lien to a position is not granted and the staff member has not secured another assignment by the end of the SLWOP, the staff member will be separated when the appointment expires in accordance with the UN Staff Regulations and Rules.  If the post of a staff member is abolished during the course of the authorized special leave, such as in an office or unit realignment, the relevant rules and policies regarding staff members on abolished posts will be applicable. The respective manager from the releasing office/unit in consultation with OHR must ensure that due process is followed for staff member whose post is abolished. This includes sharing information with the staff member about the realignment process, an early notification of the abolition of the post, an invitation to apply for available vacancies in UNDP and a due consideration among other candidates based on order of retention.  Salary and benefits  A staff member on SLWFP is normally considered as being on ‘duty’ status and continues to receive full salary and allowances and to accrue credits toward entitlements under the UN Staff Rules. Thus, all normal entitlements and accruals continue unchanged when SLWFP is granted. The following entitlements may be modified if the staff member is away from their duty station for a period of three months or more:  Post adjustment; Mobility, hardship and non-removal allowances; Rental subsidy;  Home leave cycle; Non-accrual of international benefits if the staff member is in their home country; and Representation allowance.  When a staff member is placed on SLWFP in their home country, they cease to accrue credits towards repatriation grant as of the first day of SLWFP, regardless of duration.  When a staff member is granted SLWPP, post adjustment and all other allowances are reduced in the same proportion as salary.  When a staff member granted SLWPP for extended illness, the staff member receives their education grant in full, if entitled.  During SLWOP a staff member will receive no salary or allowances from UNDP.  When a staff member is on SLWOP, the amount of the education grant and related benefits shall be prorated on the basis of the period of eligible service compared to the full academic year. Health and life insurance  SLWFP or SLWPP does not interrupt the coverage of the staff member under the health and/or life insurance plans to which the staff member has subscribed. For partial pay, UNDP will pay partial subsidy, and the staff member pays the rest of the premiums. For full pay, the contributions of the staff member and UNDP remain the same during the leave.   SLWOP of less than 30 calendar days does not interrupt the coverage under health and/or life insurance plans to which the staff member has subscribed. The contributions of the staff member and UNDP remain the same and are paid in full during the leave.  In the case of SLWOP for 30 calendar days or more, the staff member has the option of continuing coverage by making full payment (their contribution plus the UNDP contribution) of the premiums involved. UNDP does not subsidize health or life insurance coverage during SLWOP of 30 calendar days or more.   The payments by staff members are to be made in advance on a quarterly basis, as follows:  Locally recruited staff members stationed outside New York: arrange payments through the HR Administrator at the duty station concerned; and  Internationally recruited staff members and locally recruited staff members stationed in New York: contact the GSSU or JPOSC focal point to arrange payment of premiums via check (payable to UNDP) or preferably wire transfer (instructions will be provided by the HR focal point).  After Service Health Insurance (ASHI) may be available to a staff member who has been on SLWOP and separates from the Organization, if the staff member opts for continuing coverage as outlined in paragraph 40 (above) and meets the eligibility criteria spelled out in the policy governing ASHI.   Appendix D  Although a staff member on special leave (with or without pay) continues to be bound by the UN Staff Regulations and Rules, the fact that the staff member is not in active service means that they are not covered under Appendix D to the UN Staff Rules that govern compensation for service-incurred death, injury or illness.   Malicious Acts Insurance Policy  A staff member on special leave (with or without pay) is covered by the Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP) and must, therefore, comply with the safety and security measures under the respective UNDP Security Plan. Failure to comply with security instructions may invalidate the insurance coverage. Pension fund  SLWFP or SLWPP does not interrupt the staff member’s participation in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF). For partial pay, the entitlement to and the amounts of benefits shall be equivalent to the partial pay ratio.   SLWOP for less than 30 calendar days does not interrupt the staff member’s participation in the UNJSPF. The contributions of the staff member and UNDP remain the same and are paid in full during the leave.   In the case of SLWOP for more than 30 calendar days, the staff member has the option of continuing participation in the UNJSPF by making full payment (their contribution plus the UNDP contribution). UNDP does not subsidize contributions to the Pension Fund during SLWOP. The payments by staff members are to be made in advance on a monthly basis, as follows:  Locally recruited staff members stationed outside New York: Premium contributions from the staff member must be remitted to the UNDP office by arranging payments through the HR Administrator/Operations Officer at the duty station concerned. A deposit of funds received should be created in the appropriate accounts in UNALL. The information should then be recorded in the United Nations Pension Page in Quantum;  All internationally recruited staff members and locally recruited staff members in New York: Premium contributions from the staff member, must be remitted to the UNDP Payroll Finance Unit, GSSU in Kuala Lumpur by cheque payable to UNDP for the full amount of the contributions or preferably by funds transfer. A deposit of funds received should be created in the appropriate accounts in the Quantum. The information should then be recorded in the United Nations Pension Page in Quantum;  Staff members should first consult with their HR Administrator regarding payment requirements under SLWOP. Those who contemplate suspending payments to the Pension Fund during SLWOP should ensure they have carefully read Article 21 of the rules of the UNJSPF regarding the conditions for retaining membership in the Fund (which is affected by the duration of non-contributory periods). For example, as per Article 21(c), a participant is deemed to have separated from the Pension Fund when they have completed a consecutive period of three years of leave without pay without concurrent contributions. Service credit for entitlement accrual  All normal accruals continue unchanged when SLWFP has been granted.  All accrued annual leave must be exhausted prior to starting SLWOP, except in the case of SLWOP granted for military service as per staff rule 5.3 (c), for technical assignment as per staff rule 5.3 (b) or SLWOP following any of the parental leave entitlements, or as per paragraph 11 (k), SLWOP granted to locally recruited staff members for UNV assignments.   SLWOP for less than 30 calendar days: Service credit towards sick leave, annual leave and home leave, salary increments, seniority, termination indemnity and repatriation grant shall continue to accrue if the period of special leave is for less than 30 calendar days. Periods of SLWOP of less than 30 calendar days will count in determining the duration of service at a particular duty station.  Continuity of service shall not be considered broken by periods of special leave.  SLWOP exceeding 30 calendar days: Service credit towards sick leave, annual leave and home leave, salary increments, seniority, termination indemnity and repatriation grant shall cease to accrue if the period of special leave exceeds 30 calendar days. Periods of SLWOP exceeding 30 calendar days shall not count in determining the duration of service at a particular duty station.   Privileges and immunities  Although a staff member on special leave (with or without pay) continues to be bound by the UN Staff Regulations and Rules and the Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service, the fact that the staff member is not in active service means that the staff member does not enjoy the privileges and immunities accorded to staff members as officials of the United Nations by the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN, such as the use of a United Nations Laissez-Passer (UNLP). Therefore, the UNLP must be handed over to the HR Administrator/Operations Officer for safekeeping before commencing special leave. If any issue related to privileges and immunities occurs during the special leave, the Legal Support Office must be advised without delay. Visa status  Visas which a staff member has been granted on the basis of their employment with the Organization pertain to active service. A staff member’s authorized stay in the United States expires automatically upon separation from service (which includes entry into special leave with or without pay of more than 30 days) or transfer to a duty station outside the United States, even if the G-4 visa stamped in the passport indicates that it is valid beyond the separation or transfer date.  If a staff member on special leave wishes to remain in the duty station for study purposes, for instance, the staff member is responsible for obtaining the requisite visa. UNDP will not sponsor or support any such applications and will abide by its obligations towards the host country. Equipment and identification cards  Equipment and identification cards granted to a staff member on the basis of their employment with the Organization pertain to active service and must, therefore, be handed over to the HR Administrator/Operations Officer before commencing any form of special leave. Return to active service after special leave without pay  Staff members on SLWOP holding a lien against a specific position must notify the respective unit of their return at least three months prior to their return.   For staff members holding a general lien (i.e. who were granted special leave without the identification of a specific post), return to active service depends on the outcome of their successful job search, which in turn depends on the availability of posts, the required competencies, location, timing as well as overall operational realities of the Organization. This search must take place during the period of SLWOP. Therefore, preferably six months and certainly no later than three months prior to the date of return, it is the staff member’s responsibility to contact the respective HR Business Partner or HR Administrator in Country Offices and:   Begin an active search for suitable vacancies by, inter alia:   Sending their updated Curriculum Vitae and the last three Performance Evaluation reports to the HR Business Partner/HR Administrator; and Applying for suitable vacant posts advertised within UNDP for which the staff member considers themselves qualified; or  Request extension of SLWOP within the maximum period of 24 months; or  Resign from UNDP.  For staff members holding a PA or FTA, the UNDP HR Business Partner or the HR Administrator in Country Offices as appropriate will:   Assist the staff member concerned by supporting their efforts by advocating on the staff member’s behalf to the units for which vacancies the staff member submitted their application; and  Whenever possible (e.g. as part of corporate selection/reassignment exercises) put the staff member’s name forward as a candidate to be reviewed, along with other applicants, for UNDP posts which are vacant or becoming vacant and are at the same grade level as the staff member’s level prior to the leave and for which the staff member is qualified in terms of academic qualifications, job-related skills and work-related experience. For internationally recruited staff members, such posts may be located at any duty station; and for locally recruited staff members, located at their current duty station. The staff member will be informed if they are being considered for any suitable vacant post.   If the staff member is selected for a suitable post in UNDP but they do not accept it, UNDP is no longer required to assist the staff member in finding a suitable post. The staff member will continue to be considered an internal candidate for the vacant posts for which they apply while on SLWOP.   If at the end of the SLWOP, the efforts by staff members holding a PA to find a post are unsuccessful and the staff member has not reached the maximum allowable SLWOP of two years, the staff member may request an additional extension of SLWOP to search for a suitable post within the maximum allowable period of two years.  No staff member shall return to pay status without a post. In case of separation any applicable notice period will be paid in cash. Separation from service after special leave without pay  If the staff member has not identified or accepted a suitable placement at the expiry of SLWOP or its extension(s), they will be separated from service in accordance with the UN Staff Regulations and Rules or the terms specified in the letter granting the approval for SLWOP.  Requests and authorization for special leave with or without pay   Requests for special leave - with or without pay - should be made no later than two months before the period for which staff members anticipate taking such leave. When the special leave is being requested for highly compelling and personal reasons, on an emergency basis, i.e. for reasons that could not be anticipated two months in advance, the request may be considered on an exceptional basis. Requests for SLWOP must be submitted through eServices in UNALLor SLWOP leave request form clearly indicating the reason for the leave. Requests for any other special leave can be made with a standard Special Leave request form, with a detailed explanation and supporting documentation for the request. Unless the request for SLWOP is motivated by the wish to have outside activities, in which case the request must be addressed to the Director, OHR, for consideration, in all other cases, special leave requests will be addressed as follows: a)\tFor locally recruited staff members:  i)  holding FTAs and PAs in Headquarters, New York, to the respective HR Business Partner serving the organizational unit; ii) \tholding FTAs and PAs in other locations outside of New York, including country offices, the respective Head of Office; iii)\tholding TAs, their respective Head of Office. b)\tFor all internationally recruited staff members:  i) \tholding FTAs and PAs, the HR Business Partner serving the organizational unit or duty station.  ii) \tFor staff members holding TAs, their respective Head of Office. Approving authority  The following approval authority will be applied: a)\tFor locally recruited staff members:  i) \tholding FTAs and PAs in headquarters, New York, the Director, OHR; ii) \tserving in other locations outside of New York, including country offices, the Head of the Office; iii) \tholding TAs, their respective Head of Office. b)\tFor all internationally recruited staff members:  i) \tholding FTAs and PAs, the Director, OHR; \t ii) \tholding TAs, their respective Head of Office.  The Director of OHR will not consider any requests for special leave which have not previously been endorsed by the Head of Office.  Where appropriate, particularly in case of doubt that the activities performed by the staff member during special leave may violate the United Nations Standard of Conduct, the Director of OHR, who is the approving authority, may consult with the UNDP Ethics Advisor and/or the Legal Support Office.  Implementation  Upon approval of any type of special leave, a communication to the staff member to this effect stating the terms of the leave and administrative formalities (together with a copy of this policy) is prepared by the respective HR contact in UNDP, and should include the following information:  a) \tThey remain a staff member while on special leave (with or without pay);  b)\tEffective date of the leave;  c)\tExpiration date of the leave;  d)\tConfirmation that all accrued annual leave to date will be exhausted prior to commencing special leave (with or without pay) except for reasons mentioned under paragraphs 49 and 50; e)\tWhether the special leave is approved against a specific post or on a general basis (if against a specific post the post number will be indicated);  f)\tIf the special leave is without pay and is for more than 30 calendar days, notification:  i) \tThat the staff member will not earn service credit toward seniority, salary increments, sick leave, annual and home leave, repatriation grant or termination indemnity;  ii) \tThat continuous service in the UNJSPF will accrue only if the staff member arranges to continue to pay both their own contribution plus the Organization's contribution during the leave period, with the understanding that rates may change; iii) \tThat health and life insurance will continue only if the staff member arranges to continue to pay both their own contribution plus the Organization’s contribution during the leave period, with the understanding that rates may change. g)\tThat the staff member should provide contact information such as telephone numbers, mailing address, banking details and ensure that a valid UNDP email account, as well as access to the intranet be maintained and remain active throughout the approved period of special leave including the job search period. The staff member is required to keep the HR Business Partner / HR Administrator updated of any change in the information provided while on special leave; h)\tPrior to departure on special leave of any type, the staff member is required to settle any outstanding obligations and undergo the necessary clearance procedures as applicable such as exit interview and signed attendance records;  i)\tIn case of separation upon expiry of SLWOP, whether it is a termination or agreed separation the salary scale to be used for the payment of final entitlements is the salary scale in effect on the close of business date. However, in highly exceptional cases where SLWOP exceeded the maximum allowable period of 2 years, the salary scale to be used for payment of final entitlements is the salary scale in effect on the last day of active service.  Monitoring  The approving office will keep a record of any special leave that has been approved for future reference.   ",
    "staff-assessment": "Staff Assessment    Staff assessment is the difference between the gross and net rates of salary scales.    In order to avoid inequalities in the level of taxation between staff members of different nationalities, a uniform amount of tax (i.e., staff assessment) is levied by the United Nations and only the resulting net amount is paid to the staff member. Like most national income tax scales, the scale of staff assessment is progressive, i.e., the higher the salary, the higher the percentage rate of assessment. The amount of the staff assessment is credited to the Tax Equalization Fund.     Those Member States that do not impose income tax on UN earnings receive a portion of the Tax Equalization Fund as an offset against their assessments for the UN regular budget, peacekeeping, and tribunal budgets. When staff members have to pay national income taxes on their UN earnings, they are reimbursed from the Tax Equalization Fund irrespective of the total amount of staff assessment deducted from their salaries.    UN salaries are normally not taxable by governments. Certain governments, however, which have not acceded to the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, require the payment of income tax on UNDP earnings. Since this is in addition to the staff assessment levied by UNDP, the Organization refunds to the staff member the amount of income tax he/she has paid. Such refunds take into account any tax levied on elements of remuneration not subject to staff assessment. Detailed instructions are issued annually to staff members concerned.     Staff assessment is applied to gross salary and special post allowance and to pensionable amounts of separation payments.     International Professional and Higher Categories     The assessment scale also differentiates between staff with a recognized dependent spouse (or a first dependent child, if there is no dependent spouse) and those without dependants. A higher rate of assessment is applied to the gross salary of those without dependants, who thus receive a lower net salary. The ‘dependency’ or ‘with dependants’ rate of staff assessment is applied if the staff member has a dependent spouse or dependent child. The ‘single’ or ‘without dependants’ rate is applied to all other staff members. As a result, no dependency allowance is payable in respect of a dependent spouse or the first dependent child.     When both spouses are employed in the International Professional and higher categories, the single rate of staff assessment is applied. If, however, there is a dependent child, the dependency rate of staff assessment is applied to the spouse receiving the higher salary and the single rate to the other.  ",
    "taxation": "Taxation        United Nations salaries are normally not taxable by governments. Certain governments, however, that have not acceded to the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations require the payment of income tax on UNDP earnings. Since this is in addition to the staff assessment levied by UNDP, the Organization refunds to the staff member the amount of income tax that he/she has paid. Such refunds take into account any tax levied on elements of remuneration not subject to staff assessment.        A UN Information Circular is issued annually to staff members concerned. It explains the entire procedure and includes a \"Most Frequently Asked Questions\" section.        Staff members who need detailed tax advice and/or tax forms should refer to the www.un.org/tax website, which includes quick links to the Internet sites for the IRS and State help services.

Temporary Appointments  \t1.1 \tBasic Principles  These guidelines on Temporary Appointments (TA) come into effect on 1 January 2018. The guidelines cover the principles, policies and procedures for the administration of TAs and reinforce the following elements:  Correct use of the TA;    Proper budget planning;     Transparency and objectivity in job classification and recruitment based on the highest standards of competence and integrity;     Empowerment of managers with full delegated authority and accountability;     Clarity in the lines of roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in TA management.     Close corporate oversight through monitoring, evaluation and reporting on the management of TAs;    \t 1.2 \tLegal Framework  Staff members recruited under a TA are governed by UN Staff Regulations and Rules including:    Staff members holding a TA must abide by the UN standards of conduct outlined in Chapter I of the amended Staff Regulations and new Staff Rules.    Staff members may be subject to disciplinary action as described in Chapter IX of the Staff Regulations and Rules.    Staff members can avail themselves of the grievance resolutions mechanisms provided for within the UN Administration of Justice System (informal and formal) as described in Chapter X of the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.    The TA does not carry any expectancy of renewal, legal or otherwise, or of conversion to any other type of appointment and expires automatically and without prior notice on the expiration date specified in the Letter of Appointment.    The selection of staff appointed on a TA does not require a review by any Compliance Review Bodies i.e. Compliance Review Board (CRB) or Compliance Review Panel (CRP). Therefore, a TA holder is not considered an internal candidate for the purpose of internal vacancies. However, he/she is welcome to apply for positions which are externally advertised for which he/she meets the requirements.  By accepting the offer of a TA and signing the Letter of Appointment, staff members acknowledge and accept that the terms of employment are distinct from those that apply to other types of appointment.  As the TA is a stand-alone appointment and cannot be converted into any other type of appointment; the period served under a TA does not count for the purposes of seniority for entitlements involving seniority, including but not limited to the Repatriation Grant and Termination Indemnity.     Time served under a TA appointment does not count toward eligibility criteria for a possible Continuing Appointment (CA) when such a type of appointment may be granted.    While a TA is a staff appointment that is intended for a short duration not exceeding 364 days, the UN Staff Rules provide for a possible extension for an additional period of 1 year, bringing the maximum duration to 1 year and 364 days. Such  extension is not automatic and is reviewed and approved by the Head of Bureau or Resident Representative. Refer to  Chapter 5, section 5.10.7 for guidance on the  conditions under which a TA can be extended.     \t1.3 \tTemporary Appointment: Definition    A TA is a staff appointment governed by the amended UN Staff Regulations and Rules for activities expected to be of a finite and temporaryt duration not exceeding one year and 364 calendar days.     \t1.4 \tWhen to use a Temporary Appointment  Pursuant to Staff Rule 4.12, the TA modality is to be used under limited circumstances as follows:   to appoint staff for seasonal or peak workloads and specific short-term requirements for less than one year with an expiration date specified in the letter of appointment; or     to replace a staff member for a limited period (maternity leave, SLWOP, etc.) provided the replacement is less than one year.    An Individual Contractor (IC) must not be used for functions normally performed by staff or in replacement of staff member for any period of time.  \t1.5 \tExamples of the correct use of a Temporary Appointment  The determining factor in establishing a TA position instead of a Fixed-Term Appointment (FTA) position is whether the job can be definitively described as finite and for a duration of less than one year.  While the elements of most jobs can be broken down into stages with each component stage being considered “short term‟, the TA modality is to be used when the entire known elements/functions of the job will not exceed one year.      The nature of the funding is not a determining factor for using a TA instead of a FTA. The only factors to take into account are the expected nature and duration of the functions.     The TA contractual modality is the appropriate contract:   For specific functions related to supporting project activities that are focused on a specific deliverable, where it is clear from the outset that the activities once completed will be discontinued and the incumbent not retained.   Temporary replacement of existing staff for reasons of health, reassignment or short-term redeployment; to employ full-time staff whose services are temporarily required in the office but for which staff accountability and status are required of the functions;   For some project deliverables (due to their limited duration, highly technical or specialized nature, crisis situations, etc.) which do not require establishment of an Executive Board approved position.   Supervisory responsibilities assigned to a TA holder should be in line with the job functions and clearly spelled out in the Job Description.  In exceptional circumstances, for example replacement in a managerial function where the incumbent is on extended leave, a TA holder may perform limited managerial and supervisory functions with clear delegation of authority defined by respective Heads of Office/Bureau/Division.  \t1.6 \tExamples of the incorrect use of a Temporary Appointment  The TA contract modality must NOT be used:   for functions that  are expected to go beyond  one year and 364 days or more;    to utilize a quicker recruitment process or to avoid regular recruitment procedures for filling a FTA post;    to hire staff to perform the duties of existing staff whose performance is unsatisfactory, thus trying to resolve performance problems;     to bypass the proper budget planning process and requirement to establish the positions in accordance with the relevant policies and procedures;     to inflate or minimize remuneration;    as a temporary contract pending the completion of a recruitment process;     as a concurrent appointment of a UNDP staff member, including staff on Special Leave Without Pay (SLWOP), who is already on a FTA with UNDP or on a non-staff contract status with UNDP;    as a probationary appointment.    \t1.7 \tGranting of a TA to a former UNDP staff member    UNDP staff members who hold Fixed-Term Appointments (FTA), Permanent Appointments (PA) or Continuing Appointments (CA) appointments cannot be separated for the sole purpose of being appointed on a TA with UNDP.     Former staff members who are separated on grounds of disciplinary action or unsatisfactory performance must not be re-hired under any new contractual modality, including a TA.    A staff member separated for abolition of post or reduction in posts cannot be offered a TA with the same functions he/she occupied before separation. In the case of separation because of retirement or abolition of post, the break in service requirement applicable to the type of separation must be strictly adhered to. No exception shall be granted to the minimum required break in service. [See Annex IV.]    The appointment of a former staff member, who was paid a termination indemnity, requires a minimum break in service between the separation date and the new appointment; unless a prorated amount of the termination benefit is returned by the former staff member. The details must be confirmed with the respective HR Business Partner and GSSU.    A staff member who was paid a termination indemnity as part of an Agreed Separation from UNDP will be required to take a minimum break in service of 2 years, beginning from the effective date of his/her separation, unless a prorated amount of the termination indemnity is returned by the former staff member. This break in service is applicable to all staff contracts throughout the UN Common system.     Any offer of a TA to a former UNDP staff member who separated upon expiry of a FTA or resignation from a FTA, PA or CA, must be made after a break in service of at least 1 month and is subject to reference checking.  Upon appointment the former staff member must explicitly accept the TA modality and renounce to any claim in respect to his/her former FTA, PA or CA from which she/she resigned or the FTA which lapsed upon expiry.     Chapter 2 : Budget Planning  There are a number of critical budget planning steps that each unit needs to take with regard to Temporary Positions (position type “TEMP‟):   A Temporary Position can be established and advertised pending confirmation of the monetary budget allocations. However, the budget planning and funds sufficiency checks must be closely monitored and hiring units must ensure that the budget allocations have been approved for the full duration of the TA before an offer of appointment is issued to a selected candidate;   The hiring unit must ensure that sufficient General Operating Expense (GOE) resources are available to cover the cost of the Temporary Position for the full duration of the TA;   The unit must also ensure that the budget for the project against which the Temporary Position has been established reflects the funding needs as per the Proforma cost for Temporary Positions [ Staff Pro-Forma and that the correct chart fields from the GOE are associated to the Temporary Position.    A Temporary Position may be established and advertised pending confirmation of the monetary budget allocations. However, the budget planning and funds sufficiency checks must be closely monitored and hiring units must ensure that the budget allocations have been approved for the full duration of the TA before an offer of appointment is issued to a selected candidate   Delegation of authority related to Position Management    Position management will be delegated to country offices/business units at outlined in Annex 1 thereafter.     Chapter 3 : Temporary Appointment Position Management    \t3.1 \tDelegation of authority   The authority to establish and fill TA positions is delegated to the respective Heads of Office/Bureau/Division.  [See Delegation of authority table at Annex I]    \t3.2 \tPosition designation: Temporary Appointments     The purpose of a TA assignment is to perform specific functions that are for a clearly limited and finite period. Therefore, this type of assignment will not require the formal establishment of a post by the Executive Board.     \t3.3 \tPosition number  The creation of local TA positions will be decentralized as of 1 July 2009. The creation of all international TA positions has been also decentralized to country offices.  [Please refer to Annex 1]    \t3.4 \tJob description   All TAs require a complete job description (JD), prepared by the supervisor, with the assistance of the respective Human Resources unit using the standard UNDP Job Description Template.  TA JDs should emphasize the essential qualifications, experience and competencies for the job and clearly define the functions and expected results to be completed within the finite prescribed period.    \t3.5 \tJob Classification principles and authority  Job classification is a mechanism for determining the grade level of each position in the Organization, on the basis of clearly established criteria, and for ensuring that positions with the same level of responsibilities and accountability are graded at the same level.  While TAs are short-term in nature, it remains important that their JDs accurately reflect the full content of their expected contribution and that their roles are consistently graded in relation to current structure and jobs of the office.  As with FTA posts, the classification of the TA posts will be in accordance with the relevant job evaluation standard and the remuneration will be based on the relevant grade of applicable salary scale and UNDP’s policy on step setting.    The basic principles of the UNDP job evaluation system are:    The level of responsibility and accountability of the positions in question is the primary basis for determining the level of the position.    Every position should be supported by an up-to-date job description which clearly describes the content of jobs, levels of responsibility and accountability, functions, main results expected and impact of the results, relationships between the position and other staff in and outside the Organization, main competencies required and minimum recruitment requirements.    3.5.1 Centralized and decentralized classification  The table below provides guidance on the delegation of authority for classification of posts. [See also Annex I].     As a transitional measure, all local TAs will be provisionally classified at the CO level but require approval from OHR prior to appointment.  COs are expected to complete all the necessary documentation for the classification with OHR‟s role being solely quality assurance and confirmation of policy adherence during the initial implementation of the TA modality.  CO‟s must not use this requirement as an opportunity to delegate the classification activity to HQ.  Incomplete documentation will be returned to the hiring Unit and the appointment process might be significantly delayed.  3.5.2 Classification Process  For complete guidance on job classification standards and the benchmark definitions of grades and categories, [please see Job Evaluation]   and International Civil Service Commission].   3.5.3 Effective Date of Classification   The new grade of a position is implemented effective the first day of the month Chapter 4 following the receipt of a complete submission.  The effective date of classification is Recruitment and Selection Process for Temporary Appointment assigned only if the position number, budget and other required  information/documentation are available.        Chapter 4 : Recruitment and Selection of Temporary Appointments      This chapter describes the recruitment and selection process for filling internationally recruited and local TAs under the Staff Rules.  All TAs are considered non-rotational.                       \t4.1 \tPrinciples of Recruitment    The same fundamental principles as described in the UNDP’s Recruitment Framework apply to the recruitment of TA holders, i.e. competitive process, objective selection, transparency, diversity and accountability.  (See Annex II).    \t4.2  \tRecruitment and selection process     The recruitment of TA holders must strike a balance between fulfilling the above mentioned principles and related processes while at the same time being as simple and quick as possible to administer given the time-bound nature of a TA.  This places responsibility on Hiring Managers and candidates to act within both the letter and spirit of the rules in all aspects of the recruitment process.          The following outlines the essential requirements of a TA recruitment process:    The position must be properly budgeted, classified and established prior to being advertised.     A complete vacancy announcement, stating all the competencies and other corporate requirements for the position must be advertised externally, normally for two weeks, but at least for a minimum period of one week;    All candidates must complete and submit a signed Personnel history form (P.11) (or online equivalent) together with an application;    Only the criteria specified in the Vacancy Announcement must be used in the review and screening of applications;     Only candidates who meet all the requirements of the post (e.g. academic, experience, languages etc.), as specified in the vacancy announcement may be given consideration for the position;    No recruitment and selection process is complete without proper verification of critical information, including academic qualifications, languages, nationality, prior UN experience, family relationship within the UN Common system and detailed reference checks, including with former employers of the candidate who may not be listed as a reference.   The selection of a candidate must take into account the results from all the assessment methods indicated in the recruitment plan for the post including any technical assessment/interview, reference checks and performance report.  The Hiring Manager is accountable for ensuring all recruitment procedures are properly followed and documented.      For detailed guidance on the recruitment process please refer to Annex II.    \t4.3 \tRecruitment of former or retired staff members       Former staff members or UN retirees, above the mandatory age of separation, may be appointed under TA, only if:    The appointment represents an operationally sound solution to meet the needs of the service;     The record shows that a competitive process was carried out;     The break in service requirement of 3 months is met;     The former staff member or retiree was not separated on grounds of disciplinary action or unsatisfactory performance; and    Provided the former staff member or retiree is medically cleared.    The Hiring Manager must ensure that the remuneration of a UNDP (or UN and its funds and programmes) retiree does not exceed the limits set for those receiving a pension from the UNJSPF, currently set at $50,000  or 6 months per calendar year whichever comes first. The cumulative period of service shall not exceed 6 months in one calendar year and is nonrenewable. Refer to ST/AI/2013/4.      Retirees who opt to defer their pension benefits during the period of the TA are exempt from the above-mentioned limits.    Chapter 5 : Administration of the Temporary Appointment  \t5.1 \tProcess for Initial Appointment  The following outlines the steps that must be taken in the initial appointment of a TA holder.  5.1.1 International Temporary Appointments  Once the selection process has been finalized the Hiring Unit must prepare all relevant documentation and take action for processing of the appointment as follows:  Step 1: Initiate Medical clearance process with selected candidate.  Step 2: Verification and determination of salary step on appointment.    Step 3: Once verification and step determination is complete the Hiring Unit submits a request for recruitment to GSSU Copenhagen in order for GSSU to process the appointment:  Issue offer letter  Follow up and ensure that medical clearance is received  Ensure that the requested documentation from selected candidate is received  Process travel documents in collaboration with CO and HQ  Process travel entitlements, if applicable  Issue Letter of Appointment  Process hire in  Quantum and set up in payroll  Ensure enrollment in United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), if duration of TA is six months or more,  Ensure enrollment in insurance plans as applicable  Please refer to Check list for TA appointments in Annex III  5.1.2  Local Temporary Appointments (Headquarters and Country Offices including both GS and National Professionals)  Once the selection process has been finalized, the Hiring Unit must prepare all relevant documentation and take action for processing of the appointment as follows:  Step1: Process Medical clearance.  Step 2: Process the appointment:  Determine salary and entitlements  Issue offer letter   Ensure requested documentation from selected candidate received   Issue letter of appointment   Process hire in Quantum and set up in payroll  Ensure enrollment in UNJSPF, if applicable  Ensure enrollment in insurance plans as applicable  Please refer to Check list for TA appointments in Annex III  5.2 Duration of appointment   The initial duration of a Temporary Aappointment shall not exceed  364 calendar days.  The appointment of a staff member who has served for the maximum period of 364 calendar days, may be renewed for up to one additional year when warranted by surge requirements and operational needs related to special measures, field operations and special projects with finite mandates under circumstances and conditions established by the Secretary-General. \t5.3 \tDetermining salary step on appointment   Please refer to Experience and Academic Qualifications All new appointments in the Professional categories for TAs begin at step I (one) of the appropriate grade.  One additional step may be granted for each additional year of relevant work experience beyond the minimum required for appointment at step I (one) of the grade up to:  A maximum of step VI (six) for P-4/NO-D and below;  A maximum of step V (five) for P-5/and D-1/P-6 appointments;  All D-2/P-7 appointments, regardless of the experience of candidates, start at step I (one).  For new TA appointments in GS category, candidates are appointed at step I (one) of the salary scale. One additional step may be granted for each additional year of relevant work experience beyond the minimum required for appointment at step I (one) of the grade up to a maximum of step V (five).    Hiring Units are authorized to grant up to Step V (five) for GS, P5 and P6/D1 positions and up to Step VI (six) for positions from P1-P4/NOA-NOD. Should an office wish to grant a step higher than that as outlined in 5.3 (a), a request for exceptional approval must be sent to the Director, OHR/NY.     \t5.4 \t Offer and Letter of Appointment  The Offer of Appointment must include the Summary of Conditions of Services and all administrative forms. The Letter of Appointment (LOA) granted for TA holders contains expressly or by reference all the terms and conditions of employment. All contractual entitlements of staff members are strictly limited to those contained expressly or by reference in their Letter of Appointment.    \t5.5 \tMedical Clearance   5.5.1 Medical clearance for Temporary Appointments of less than six months: Individuals who are expected to work on a temporary appointment in any UNDP office for less than 6 months will be required to submit a “Statement of Good Health” from a qualified medical practitioner prior to commencement of work. In addition to the Statement of Good Health, individual subscribers who are expected to travel within or outside the country of their residence, shall be additionally required to submit from a recognized UN physician a statement certifying that the individual is in good health, is fit to travel and has had the required inoculations for the country or countries to which the individual is to travel.   5.5.2 Medical clearance for Temporary Appointments of more than six months:  A medical examination consistent with the requirements of the UN Medical Service is required for every individual appointed under a TA for more than six months.  The medical examination, which includes X-ray, must be undertaken by the UN Examining Physician or other recognized physician, before any UNDP offer of appointment is made.  If the TA staff member was initially appointed for less than six months and is subsequently extended in accordance with the limited conditions of extension, he/she will be required prior to the extension to undertake a medical examination by the UN Examining Physician.  5.5.3 Medical clearance for Temporary Appointments covering specific functions irrespective of duration of appointment: Individuals who are expected to work on a temporary appointment in security service functions, as drivers and those assigned to nonfamily duty stations irrespective of the duration are required to undergo a full medical examination as outlined above in 5.5.2.  5.5.4 Medical expenses and result of medical examination  Medical Clearance expenses, subject to the maximum reimbursable rates established by UNMSD, are borne by the organization, and should be charged against the same Chart of Accounts where the staff member’s salary is charged. (Average costs should be factored into the pro forma costs).    The clearance of the UN Examining Physician or other qualified medical practitioner is required for the purpose of issuing the TA appointment. The medical examination clearance should be placed in the relevant file of the TA holder.  In case it is required at a later date in the case of a claim for disability or injury.  Should a change of duty station take place, a new medical clearance must be obtained.    A Letter of Appointment cannot be issued without the proper medical clearance.        \t5.6 \tIndex Number  A TA holder who has already been assigned a UN Index number because of previous work experience with the UN will retain the same index number. Otherwise, a new number should be established for a new TA holder who was previously not issued an index number.   \t5.7 \tEntry on Duty Date  The appointment under a TA shall take effect from the date on which the staff member enters into official travel status to assume his or her duties where applicable, or, if no official travel is involved, from the date on which the staff member starts to perform his or her duties.   \t5.8 \tMedical Insurance  The TA holder must be enrolled in an applicable medical insurance plan.  Please refer to Social Security page POPP.  After Service Health Insurance (ASHI) for former staff members is suspended for the duration of a TA assignment when the assignment is more than 6 months or the earnings exceed the limit of $50,000 whichever comes first. In that case the staff members should apply participation in the applicable insurance plan. These former staff retains their eligibility and may re-enter ASHI upon completion of the TA. Contributions to ASHI will be suspended during periods of TAs and will resume upon re-entry into ASHI.  \t5.9 \tPension Fund Participation (UNJSPF)  Staff members on TAs of six months or longer or who complete six months of service without an interruption of more than thirty days are eligible for participation in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF).  (See section 6.3)   Former staff members that are employed on a TA for six months or longer will re-enter the UNJSPF. Under UNJSPF Regulations and Rules, while a staff member is a participant in the UNJSPF, the staff member will not continue to receive a pension benefit. This means that for the period of six months or more that the staff member is a participant of the UNJSPF, the pension benefit will stop and resume upon separation from the TA.  In most cases, upon re-entry to the UNJSPF, the staff member will retain the previously assigned Pension Fund number for continuity purposes. .   \t5.10 \tOther Administrative Conditions  5.10.1 Salary scale adjustments  Salary scale adjustments will be applied when authorized by the ICSC as communicated by the UN Secretariat.  5.10.2 Part time Temporary Appointments (not applicable to TAs of less than six months)  TA holders may be contracted on a part-time basis. It should be noted however, that all salary, benefits and allowances are to be calculated and paid at 50% except the Medical Insurance premiums. In line with the guidelines for part-time employment, the organization contributes 50% of its premium share and the staff member pays the difference of the full payment of the premium.    5.10.3 Dual Nationality    In accordance with Staff Rule 4.3 (a) United Nations does not recognize more than one nationality of a staff member    When a staff member has dual nationality, the UN recognizes the nationality of the State with which the staff member is, in the opinion of the Secretary-General, most closely associated (Staff Rule 4.3 (b)     5.10.4 G4 Visa and Permanent Residency – for International/Professional TAs recruited in the USA.    New staff members appointed on a TA for less than one year in New York are not required to relinquish their permanent residency in order to obtain a G-4 visa ST/AI/2000/19   However, in the case that the duration of the TA is  beyond l one year  staff members who are US Permanent Residents or Green Card holders must relinquish their permanent residency status and obtain a G-4 visa prior to the commencement of the extension.    5.10.5 Learning  Any organizational wide requirements for training such as Security Training, Ethics Training, Prevention of Harassment training etc., are also applicable to TA holders.   5.10.6 Performance Evaluation  Pursuant to Staff Rule 1.3 as with all staff, TA holders must undergo a performance evaluation for their period of service.  The performance appraisal of a TA is a simplified format of the regular Performance Management and Development (PMD) for FTAs reflecting the short-term nature of the TA functions.   There is a simplified rebuttal process for TA holders.  If the TA holder disagrees with the overall comment from his/her supervisor, he/she may provide his/her additional comments rebutting the supervisor’s evaluation, which will be maintained as part his/her Official Status File together with the performance appraisal of the supervisor.  This complete record will constitute the rebuttal process for a TA holder.  As a TA holder can perform modified supervisory or managerial functions when serving as a temporary replacement, any decision or recommendation on another staff member’s performance that may have a negative effect must be cleared by Bureaux management.       5.10.7 Extension of a Temporary Appointment  An initial TA that reaches the period of 364 days may be renewed for up to one year under very limited conditions. Under no circumstances shall the entire period on a TA exceed 729 days, i.e. one year and 364 days.  In the case that the TA needs to be extended for 1 final year beyond the first initial 364 days, a fully documented request for approval of the extension must be sent to the Head of Office or Bureau Director.   5.10.8 Successive Temporary Appointments  After the maximum  period of one year and 364 days served under a TA is completed, a mandatory break in service of at least one  monthmust take place, prior to recruitment of the same individual under another, different TA.   If  an assignment  is continuous and not time-bound  in nature, a FTA must be considered.       An individual may be granted a TA for a different assignment once the maximum duration is served subject to  a minimum break in service of thirty calendar days.     When a former TA holder is appointed under a FTA there is no need for a break in service between contracts. However as mentioned under Chapter 1 section 1.2 (k) The period served under TA does not count for the purpose of seniority for entitlements including but not limited to Repatriation Grant, Termination Indemnity, Continuing Appointment (CA). Therefore TAs may not be used as a type of probationary appointment for what is expected to be a continuing activity.    The TA is a stand-alone appointment; it does not carry any expectancy of renewal and cannot be converted into another type of appointment. Upon expiry of a TA, including in the case where an extension has been granted up to one final year bringing the total duration to one year and 364 days, the TA holder must be separated. If he/she has secured a FTA, he/she is appointed to the FTA with a new EOD, i.e. starting his/her seniority afresh.    A former Junior Professional Officer, may be granted a TA without a break in service for up to a maximum of  364 days, ONLY if an agreement exists between the donor government and the UNDP office to share the costs 50/50 for up to 364 days of the TA assignment. Once the maximum 364 day agreement period is over, the TA holder is required to take a one month break in service before he/she may be rehired under a new TA. If there is no agreement between the donor government and the country office, the JPO is required to take a one month break in service before he/she may be hired under a TA.    See Table on break in service requirements in Annex IV    5.10.9 Expiration of a Temporary Appointment   As outlined in section 8.1, a TA shall expire automatically and without prior notice on the expiration date specified in the Letter of Appointment.  The following outlines the steps that must be taken upon expiry of a TA:   5.10.10 Eligibility of Temporary Appointments for recruitment to Fixed-Term Appointments   As mentioned in Chapter 1, section 1.2 (g) a staff member holding a TA may apply for FTA positions, however, because the TA is not subject to a review and endorsement by the CRB, these staff members are considered as external candidates. Therefore, all processes applied for external candidates must be followed.   5.10.11 Procedures for Separation of an International Temporary Appointment     Once the decision for separation has been taken, a notification needs to be sent to GSSU for the processing of the separation.      For separations upon expiry of appointment, the respective hiring unit should send the notification for separation to GSSU with copy to the HR Business Partner. For separations as a result of termination initiated by the Organization, the notification for separation will be sent by the HR Business Partner to GSSU following the required review as per section 8.2.      The overall steps in the separation process are the following:        Notification sent to GSSU as per above Termination Job Data action processed in QUANTUM  Termination of pension participation, if applicable, and insurance coverage in QUANTUM Determine separation entitlements and possible outstanding receivables Issue Separation Letter  Receive requested forms and documents from staff member and business unit Process travel entitlements upon separation as applicable Obtain final clearance from Payroll Accounting Unit  Ensure that positive and negative inputs are entered in QUANTUM for finalization of staff member's final pay  Notify PFU for final payroll audit before release of final pay Issue PF/4 for release of pension benefits, if applicable         5.10.12 Procedures for Separation of a Local Temporary Appointment     Once the decision for separation has been taken, a notification needs to be sent to the local respective HR unit for the processing of the separation.      For separations upon expiry of appointment, the business unit should send the notification for separation directly to the HR officer. For separations upon termination initiated by the Organization, the notification for separation will be sent by HR Business Partner to the local HR Officer following the required review as per section 8.2.      The overall steps in the separation process are the following:       Notification sent to HR Officer as per above Termination Job Data action processed in QUANTUM  Termination of pension participation, if applicable, and insurance coverage in QUANTUM Determine separation entitlements and possible outstanding receivables Issue Separation Letter  Receive requested forms and documents from staff member and business unit Ensure that positive and negative inputs are entered in QUANTUM for finalization of staff member's final pay  Issue PF/4 for release of pension benefits, if applicable   Chapter 6:  Entitlements    \t6.1 \tSalaries and Allowances    The following entitlements are applicable to TAs. [Please also refer to Annex V.]    6.1.1 General    The remuneration (including salary, entitlements and benefits) of TA holders is established in accordance with the United Nations (UN) “common system” of salaries and allowances. The “common system” is the arrangement wherein most organizations of the UN have agreed to follow a single, coordinated set of salaries and allowances for their staff. The common system organizations include the UN, its subsidiary organizations and the specialized agencies. Please see ICSC website.      Many aspects of the common system apply equally to all staff.  However, recruitment criteria and salaries and allowances differ between two major groups of staff: internationally recruited professional staff and locally recruited support staff.      The UN has two separate approaches for establishing pay and entitlements for these two groups of staff which are summarized below.      6.1.2 Base Salary (SR 3.1)    The salary of TA holders is based on the applicable UN salary scale for the relevant staff category. Salary is expressed both in gross terms and as net base salary. Net base salary is the amount due to the staff member after application of staff assessment to gross salary (see subsection 6.1.3 below). The annual rates of gross and net base salary for each grade and step of the Professional and higher categories may be accessed at [the ICSC website]. The salary of all staff at a given grade and step is the same, irrespective of their country of origin and the duty station at which they are serving.    6.1.3 Staff Assessment (SR 3.2)    The staff assessment is comparable to national income tax: it is the difference between the gross and net rates of salary scales. In order to avoid inequalities in the level of taxation between staff members of different nationalities, a uniform amount of tax (i.e. staff assessment) is levied by the United Nations and only the resulting net amount is paid to the staff member. Like most national income tax scales, the scale of staff assessment is progressive, i.e. the higher the salary, the higher the percentage rate of assessment.     6.1.4 Reimbursement of Taxes    The UN, under Staff Regulation 3.3.(f), may reimburse income taxes paid by the staff member to US tax authorities, regardless of the nationality recognized for UN purposes.    In cases where the UN recognizes the nationality of one country and the other nationality is that of the United States, the staff member continues to be subject to applicable US laws including those on income tax. The staff member is therefore subject both to staff assessment under Staff Regulation 3.3 and to US income taxes.    When the duty station of the TA holder is the United States, the organization will reimburse the income taxes paid by the staff member to US tax authorities, regardless of the nationality recognized for UN purposes. In some circumstances, some candidates may be entitled to Settling-in Grant, DSA portion of assignment grant if they are recruited from outside New York within the USA.      6.1.5 Pensionable Remuneration (SR 3.5)    For the purposes of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF) special scales, called \"Pensionable Remuneration\" (PR), are established, as the basis for determining the contribution to be paid by the staff member and by UNDP, as well as the pension benefits to which the staff member may become entitled.     Scales of pensionable remuneration currently in force     For further information on pension benefits and contributions, see UN pension fund web site       6.1.6 Post Adjustment (SR 3.7)    Post Adjustment ensures that internationally recruited professional staff have comparable purchasing power at all duty stations despite varying costs of living at each (click here)      6.1.7 Rental Subsidy (SR 3.7)    Rental subsidy (RS) is the component of Post Adjustment that addresses inequities in housing costs in the duty station.  Rental Subsidy ensures that the overall portion of pay that goes to housing is roughly comparable for similar standards of housing.  It should be noted that depending on the housing market of a duty station, RS may be an additional amount or a deduction.    Internationally recruited TA holders irrespective of the duration of contract are entitled to RS provided all applicable conditions are met.     6.1.8 Dependency Allowance (SR 3.6)    Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria, a TA holder is entitled to receive allowances in respect of: a dependent child (or children), a dependent spouse or a secondary dependent.  When applicable, dependents of TA holder are eligible for relevant entitlements, allowances and benefits as other FTA staff in their respective category.    6.1.9 Mobility and Hardship Allowance (SR 3.13 & 3.14)    The organization provides additional remuneration through the Mobility Incentive and Hardship Allowance as service in many non-Headquarters duty stations results in certain hardships with respect to conditions of life and work.  The amounts of the Mobility Incentive and Hardship Allowance are determined by the ICSC along a five tiered scale A through E with E duty stations denoting the greatest degree of hardship and the highest hardship allowance.      Hardship allowance amounts vary according to the hardship category of duty station and staff member’s grade, regardless of family status.    Internationally Recruited TA holders are entitled to the Hardship Allowance.    The Mobility Incentive and Hardship Allowance recognize that multiple assignments of a mobile career can incur additional costs.  TA holders are not mobile and as such are not entitled to the Mobility Incentive.  Moreover, should a former TA holder take up a Fixed Term Appointment following a required break in service from a TA, the TA assignment does not count toward the overall mobility count of tours of duty.     6.1.10 Settling-in Grant (SR 7.14)    An internationally-recruited TA holder who travels on appointment at UNDP’s expense shall be paid the daily subsistence allowance portion of the Settling-in Grant for himself/herself only.     A staff member who is re-appointed under a TA in the same duty station is not entitled to any additional portion of the assignment grant. For TAs less than 30 days, the Settling-in Grant is prorated.   6.1.11 Special Operations Approach Special Operations Approach has been retired as of 1 June 2016.  6.1.12 Danger Pay    Danger Pay (DP) is a special allowance that provides a symbolic amount of additional remuneration for service in duty stations designated by the ICSC as being sufficiently dangerous to warrant the entitlement.  The amount of DP is determined by the ICSC.  UNDP pays DP on a monthly, lump sum basis for internationally recruited staff and daily for locally recruited staff for the days they are required to report to work.     All staff appointed on a TA who serve at, or travel at UNDP’s expense to a designated duty station area entitled to Danger Pay at the applicable rate.  6.1.13 Overtime and Compensatory Time-Off (SR 3.11)  Locally recruited TA holders classified at GS levels ICS 1 to ICSC 7 shall be given compensatory time off or may be paid overtime, subject to the administrative procedures established for this purpose.

Locally-recruited TA holders, for whom the organization has not assumed a responsibility for relocation to or from the duty station, will normally be expected to avail themselves of the facilities available locally. However, when an acute life-threatening medical emergency has occurred, MET will be considered when the available local facilities offer an inadequate response.   For further guidance, please visit Medical Evacuation Travel policy.    6.2.5 Security Evacuation     Internationally recruited TA holders are entitled to Security Evacuation and Relocation Travel as applicable.

These include medical and dental insurances as well as group life insurance, personal property and personal accident insurance and automobile insurance.        6.4.1 Medical Insurance (SR 6.6)  a)   Internationally Recruited staff. Medical insurance schemes available to internationally recruited staff members are commercial plans and therefore vary according to duty station.

Locally Recruited staff. The Medical Insurance Plan (MIP) is a health insurance scheme operated by the UN and related Organizations e.g., the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), for the benefit of their locally-recruited active staff members under the staff series (both in the General Service and National Officer categories) and former staff members (and their eligible family members) serving or residing at designated duty stations away from headquarters.      6.4.2 UN Global Life Insurance  UNDP has arranged for its staff members to participate in the Group Life Insurance Plan to which the United Nations has subscribed.  Currently, this is with the Aetna Life and Casualty Insurance Company.  Under this arrangement, staff members may take out insurance against death and disability.  Subject to certain conditions some staff members may also continue coverage beyond separation from service.  The premiums for this insurance are paid fully by the participants; i.e. no subsidy is payable by UNDP. Staff members have the option to participate in the United Nations Group Life Insurance Plan. 6.4.3 Compensation for death, injury or illness attributable to service – Appendix D (SR 6.4)  TA holders are eligible for compensation benefits payable under Appendix D of the United Nations Staff Rules in the event of death, injury or illness that is attributable to their service with the organization.

The MAIP is administered by the United Nations Department of Safety & Security (UNDSS), through Willis UK Limited of London, a broker representing the Underwriters, Lloyd’s of London.     All staff and Individual subscribers covered by the Malicious Acts Insurance Policy (MAIP) must comply with all Security Directives to be eligible for MAIP. Failure to comply with such security directives may constitute grounds for termination of the contract for misconduct. Staff and Non-Staff alike are required to be aware of Security Directives, including issuance of Security Clearance for travel, and completing the Field Security course.   Hiring Managers must ensure that the information on MAIP and the relevant security instructions are available to staff on appointment     For the processing of claims related to a malicious act, please visit Malicious Acts    See Annex V for List of Benefits, Entitlements Applicable to all UNDP TA holders.         Chapter 7:  Leave and Absence    7.1  Annual Leave (SR 5.1) \t  Annual leave for TA holders is accrued at the rate of 1.5 working days per month of service.  A staff member holding a TA may accumulate and carry forward (in the case of extension beyond 364 days) up to eighteen working days of AL by 1 April of any year.   Up to eighteen unused annual leave days can be commuted to cash upon separation.   It is on the responsibility of Managers and staff to organize work so that leave is taken and cash payment of unused leave avoided.     \t7.2   \tAdvance annual leave (SR 5.1 (f))  Under exceptional circumstances and to assist with an unplanned personal emergency, a TA holder may request advance annual leave pending approval by the Heads of Office/Bureau/Division. The Advance AL request should not exceed a period of 5 (five) working days. The request can be considered for approval only when:   a) \tAt the time of review, the number of advance leave days must correspond to the annual leave that would be accrued for the remaining period of the TA.   \t7.3   \tSick leave (SR 6.2)  Entitlement to certified sick leave (at full pay) is subject to a maximum rate of two working days for each month of continuous service and is carried over upon extension of the same TA. However, it should not exceed 48 days for a TA that reaches the maximum period of two years, and is not commutable to cash at the end of the contract.    A medical certificate must support any absence of more than three consecutive working days. After three uncertified sick leave days in any six-month period, medical certification for any additional days is required. If the individual surpasses the sick leave limit in a year, the period in excess of the limit will be charged against the accumulated annual leave. If there is no balance of accrued annual leave, it will be charged against the salary of the staff member.   Should separation occur before the expiration date of the appointment, sick leave utilized will be recalculated based on the credits accumulated during the actual period of service. Calculations should be based on the 21.75 working days per month.    \t7.4 \tFamily leave (uncertified sick leave used as family leave): (SR 6.2)  Entitlement to family leave (uncertified sick leave used as family emergency leave) is subject to a maximum rate of 7 days per year and cannot be commuted to cash or carried over to another contract.    \t7.5 \tMaternity Leave (SR 6.3)  TA holders are entitled to 16 weeks of maternity leave.  Please visit Maternity Leave policy.  If the TA is due to expire during the maternity leave, the appointment will not be extended to cover the full duration of the leave. The staff member will be paid for each day of unused maternity leave.    7.6 \tPaternity Leave (SR 6.3)  In the case of male staff holding a temporary appointment, a minimum of six months‟ continuous service is required before paternity leave may be granted. TA holders may request paternity leave for a total period of up to four weeks or, in the case of an internationally recruited staff member serving at a non-family duty station, up to eight weeks. Please visit Paternity Leave policy.     \t7.7 \tAdoption Leave     TA holders are not entitled to adoption leave.   See Annex V for Leave Entitlements Table  \t      Chapter 8 Separation and Termination    \t8.1 \t\tExpiry of the appointment   Staff Rule 4.12 (c) states “A temporary appointment does not carry any expectancy, legal or otherwise, of renewal. A temporary appointment shall not be converted to any other type of appointment.” A TA shall therefore expire automatically and without prior notice on the expiration date specified in the letter of appointment.     The TA is a stand-alone contract from which the TA holder is separated upon expiry date.  The separation of a TA staff member upon expiry of his/her TA is not a termination.    Concretely, the above principle means that:    A TA holder has no expectancy of being extended beyond the initial TA duration;  A TA holder has no expectancy of being extended beyond any extension(s) even if the two year maximum period is not exhausted;  A TA holder has no expectancy of being offered another TA even after a  required break-in-service is taken;  A TA holder has no expectancy of being converted into another type of appointment. However, the TA holder is welcome to apply for UNDP positions as an external candidate.     \t8.2 \tTermination (SR 9.6)      8.2.1 Termination for grounds other than dismissal for serious misconduct    A termination of a TA is a separation from service initiated by the Organization before the expiry of the TA.    All cases for terminations of TAs for the reasons indicated below (8.2.1 (d)) must be submitted to the respective HR Partner in Headquarters, for review.  Final decisions on terminations must be approved by the Director, OHR.    Separation as a result of resignation, abandonment of post, expiration of appointment, retirement, or death is not considered a termination.     A TA may be terminated for any of the following reasons:     Abolition of posts or reduction of staff;  Unsatisfactory service;  Reasons of health;  iv. \tIn the interest of the good administration of the Organization and in accordance with the standards of the Charter, provided that the action is not contested by the staff member concerned. A TA shall be terminated at the date stated in the notice of termination.    8.2.2 Termination for serious misconduct  A TA holder may be separated from service or dismissed for serious misconduct in accordance with Staff rules 10.1 and 10.2 and the UNDP Legal Framework addressing Non-Compliance with the UN Standards.   8.2.3 Termination notice  In accordance with staff rule 9.7 ( c) “A staff member whose temporary appointment is to be terminated shall be given not less than fifteen calendar days‟ written notice of such termination or such written notice as may otherwise be stipulated in his or her letter of appointment.”    In accordance with Staff Rule 9.7 (e) “No termination notice or compensation in lieu thereof shall be given in case of dismissal.     8.2.4 Termination indemnity    A Termination indemnity for foreshortening of a TA will be paid based on Staff Regulation 9.3 and annex III to the Staff Regulations. It applies to staff holding TAs for a period exceeding six months.    The Termination indemnity equals to one week of each month of uncompleted service subject to a minimum of six weeks‟ and a maximum of three months’ indemnity pay.    Payment of termination indemnity shall be calculated:     For staff in the Professional and higher categories, on the basis of the staff member’s gross salary less staff assessment according to the schedule of rates set forth in staff regulation 3.3 (b) (i);  For staff in the Field Service category, on the basis of the staff member’s gross salary less staff assessment according to the schedule of rates set forth in Staff Regulation 3.3 (b) (i), plus language allowance, if any;   iii. \tFor staff in the General Service and other locally recruited categories, on the basis of the staff member’s gross salary, including language allowance, if any, less staff assessment, according to the schedule of rates set forth in Staff Regulation 3.3 (b) (ii) applied to the gross salary alone.    \t8.3 \tSeparation entitlements  The following is a summary of the entitlements normally due to staff on separation from TA upon resignation or contract expiration:   Payment of any unpaid salary and allowances;   Payment for accrued annual leave (AL) not to exceed maximum of eighteen working days;  Return travel for eligible staff;   Transportation expenses of personal effects and household goods for eligible staff; and  Payment of a repatriation grant to eligible staff member only whose TA exceeded duration of one year.   \t 8.4 \tDeath  In the case of death, the date on which entitlement to salary, allowances and benefits shall cease shall be the date of death, unless there is a surviving spouse or dependent child.  In this event, the date shall be extended 3 months beyond the date of death as per Staff Rule 9.11 (a. vii).     \t8.5 Staff on a temporary appointment who secured a fixed-term appointment   As mentioned in Chapter 1 section 1.2 (c) when applying for UNDP TA and FTA positions, individuals holding TAs are to be considered as external candidates.  Therefore, all processes applied for external candidates must be followed.     If a TA holder is offered a fixed term appointment at the expiry of his/her TA or while holding a TA, provided that a thirty days‟ written notice of resignation is observed, the following shall apply:    The staff member will be separated from the TA and newly appointed on a fixed-term appointment.     Given that TA is a separate contractual modality there is no break in service required between the separation from a TA and a new appointment on a fixed- term contract.     The length of service served on TA will not be counted for the purposes of seniority in the new FTA.     The performance and reference under TA appointment must be checked    A new medical clearance must be acquired unless the candidate has previously gotten a full medical clearance by a UN examining physician or as required by UN Medical Services    No TA holder who is separated on the grounds of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance should be re-hired as a TA or FTA    The unused annual leave balance will be commuted to cash and cannot be carried over to an FTA    In the case where the FTA offer is for the same duty station, entitlement adjustment will be made.   Chapter 9: Transition  Section 9 on Transition from ALD to TA was retired.    Chapter 10:  Accountability    10.1 \tAccountability    The UNDP Heads of Offices/Bureaus/Divisions have delegated authority with full responsibility and accountability to grant and manage TAs. Issuance of these appointments must be in accordance with the amended UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules and these TA guidelines. The Heads of Offices/Bureaus/Divisions may wish to delegate the responsibility to respective staff in their office to facilitate administrative processing. However, the responsibility and accountability remains with the Head of Office/Bureau/Division.    Various staff in the organization share the responsibility to correctly use and administer the TA contractual modality. The following is a list of the major parties involved in the process and their respective roles.     Hiring Manager: responsible for the planning of human and financial resources necessary to meet the office goals, objectives and work plan. They are also responsible for the preparation of the TOR, the selection of the most qualified candidate against appropriately classified assignment, in a competitive and transparent manner, and for properly upholding the TA modality guidelines. The Hiring Manager should also monitor and provide oversight for the correct and appropriate use of the TAs contractual modality and take necessary action to prevent misuse. The Hiring Manager is also responsible for ensuring availability of funds for the duration of the contract and extension.     Hiring HR Unit in UNDP Office (or Executive Officer / Unit Chief in HQs): responsible for the classification of the TOR, budget allocation, creation of the Temporary Assignment position and its association to chart field string(s); administration of the Benefit, and Allowances outside and in Quantum (as applicable) and ensuring completeness and correctness of data of the Temporary Assignment in QUANTUM. The hiring unit is also responsible for bringing to the attention of the Hiring Manager and HR Business Partner, of any request or insight that does not concur with the correct application of these guidelines.    HR Business Partner: responsible for providing advisory support and guidance in the Human Resources Management and strategies. They are also responsible for monitoring the correct and appropriate use of the TA and taking necessary action to prevent misuse.     OHR: responsible for providing the policy, instruments and mechanisms to administer oversight and monitor the correct and appropriate use of TAs.    \t10.2 \tOversight, Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting   The Manager, Hiring HR Unit, HR Business Partners and OHR should use the information available in the QUANTUM database to act on their respective responsibility for oversight, monitoring and / or evaluation on the use of TAs.     Internal Audits will be conducted and organizational score cards or Benchmarks will be established on a periodic basis to ensure the reporting, monitoring and evaluation of the use of TAs.     Classification    Twice a year, Country Offices/Regional Centres and Headquarters locations outside of New York must provide an official update on all classification decisions made locally in the preceding 6 months. Country Offices and Regional Centres forward to ODU/OHR and GSSU a Table of Classification Decisions within the delegated authority in January and July. Submission of the reports is mandatory for all Country Offices/ Regional Centres and should include TAs. The table should be supported by an up-to-date Organizational chart which includes job code titles, position numbers, classified levels, source of fund (optional), type of contract and other information.     Should inconsistencies in the application of the classification policy and procedures become apparent from the report, ODU/OHR must conduct post-facto reviews of classifications.     ALL TAs will be subject to oversight through internal audits and Hiring Managers will be held accountable for the proper implementation of these recruitment and selection policies.   ANNEXES   ANNEX I : DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A TA POST           ANNEX II : RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES FOR TEMPORARY APPOINTMENTS     The Recruitment and Selection Policy is applicable to Temporary Appointments, subject to the conditions below.  Establishment of a Temporary Appointment   A Temporary Position can be established and advertised pending confirmation of the monetary budget allocations. However, the budget planning and funds sufficiency checks must be closely monitored and hiring units must ensure that the budget allocations have been approved for the full duration of the TA before an offer of appointment is issued to a selected candidate;   2. Roster    A roster is a list of pre-screened and pre-assessed candidates who have applied for a similar post over the past twelve months and were found to be qualified for the position. The creation of a roster should be approved by the Director of Office of Human Resources.     Hiring Units may elect to create rosters of internal and/or external candidates. In the event that a Hiring Unit wishes to create a roster, procedures must be established to describe its use and maintenance, including the methodology for designating individuals from the roster as candidates for vacant posts.     Rostered candidates may be added to the list of applications for a post, with the concurrence of the candidate. Prior to adding a rostered candidate to the list, the Hiring Unit shall check back with the candidate’s current or most recent UN or external employer to update and confirm the reference of the potential candidate.    The application from the rostered candidate(s) may be submitted after the closing date for applications. Names of candidates added from the roster should be so noted on the list of applications.    Rostered candidates must be fully suited and meet all the requirements and criteria for the post.  Names may not be added to a candidate short-list (see below) from a roster simply to improve the diversity of a specific candidate pool.      No candidate should remain on an active roster (making them eligible for selection by a desk review) for more than one year since their last assessment or assignment with UNDP.     The Hiring Unit, in consultation with OHR/HR, may offer the TA post to a rostered candidate without re-advertising the position.        3. Review by Compliance Review Bodies   The Compliance Review Board (CRB) at Headquarters and the Compliance Review Panels (CRPs) established at non-Headquarters locations will not review Temporary Appointments.  Therefore Hiring Managers must be extra vigilant in ensuring that the recruitment principles are adhered to.      ALL TAs will be subject to oversight through internal audits and Hiring Managers will be held accountable for the proper implementation of these recruitment and selection policies.       \t4. Recruitment of former or retired staff members    Former staff members or UN retirees, above the Mandatory age of separation, may be engaged under TA, only if:    The engagement represents both a cost-effective and operationally sound solution to meet the needs of the service; The record shows that a competitive process was carried out; The break in service requirement  is met;  The former staff member or retiree was not separated on grounds of disciplinary action or unsatisfactory performance; and  The staff member or retiree is medically cleared.    The Hiring Manager must ensure that the remuneration of a UNDP (or UN and its funds and programmes) retiree does not exceed the limits set for those receiving a pension benefit  from the UNJSPF, currently set at $50,000 per calendar year.

    "termination-appointment-reasons-health": "Termination of Appointment for Reasons of Health      1.   This section covers the situation in which a staff member is terminated for reasons of health and the procedure to award a disability benefit under the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF).      Termination      2. Termination is an action initiated by the Organization to end a staff member’s:       Permanent appointment prior to its normal date of expiration; or   Continuing appointment; or   Fixed-term appointment       Incapacity      3.   For the purposes of this section and in accordance with Article 33 (a) of the Regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), “incapacity” shall mean “incapacity for further service reasonably compatible with a staff member’s abilities, due to injury or illness constituting an impairment to health which is likely to be permanent or of long duration.”       Conditions       4.   For a staff member’s appointment to be terminated for reasons of health under UN Staff Regulation 9.3 (a) (iii) the staff member’s incapacity must be established by conclusive medical evidence that results in the award of a disability benefit under UNJSPF Regulations.   Applicability     5.   The provisions of this policy apply to all UNDP staff members governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.      Request to UN Medical Director       When a staff member has taken an extensive period of continuous or cumulative sick leave (SL), a request must be sent to the UN Medical Director for determination of whether the staff member’s illness or injury is currently or potentially a case of incapacity for further service. This should be done as early as possible and not later than six months before the staff member exhausts his/her paid leave entitlement, both SL and annual leave (AL).    The request must be submitted for:       Internationally-recruited staff members, by the OHR Business Partner serving the duty station or organizational unit;      Locally recruited staff members stationed outside New York, by the Deputy Resident Representative (Operations)      Locally recruited staff members stationed in New York, by the OHR Business Partner serving the organizational unit      The request must include:       The staff member’s SL records for the last four years      A full medical report from his/her attending physician(s) stating the exact diagnosis, treatment provided, patient’s response to treatment, prognosis, and reasons for incapacity for further services. The physician(s) must be requested to send the report in a sealed envelope marked ‘confidential’ and addressed to the UN Medical Director. If the report is received unsealed, it must be immediately sealed. No photocopies may be made of the report for the staff member’s personal file.      Any other relevant information/documentation      Review by UN Medical Director       After reviewing the staff member’s SL records, medical reports and other relevant documentation/information, the UN Medical Director will determine whether the staff member’s illness or injury constitutes an impairment to health that is likely to be permanent or of long duration.       The UN Medical Director will impart his/her conclusion to:       If an internationally recruited staff member, the OHR Business Partner serving the duty station or organizational unit      If a locally recruited staff member stationed outside New York, the Deputy Resident Representative (Operations)      If a locally recruited staff member stationed in New York, the OHR Business Partner serving the organizational unit for notification to the staff member or, where appropriate, to a member of the staff member’s family.      If the UN Medical Director concludes that such an impairment does not exist and if the staff member disagrees with the conclusion of the UN Medical Director, he/she may request a review of the matter by an independent practitioner acceptable to the UN Medical Director and the staff member or by a medical board. The medical board will consist of the following members:       A medical practitioner selected by the staff member      The UN Medical Director or a medical practitioner designated by the Medical Director; and      A third medical practitioner who will be selected by agreement between the other two members and who will not be a medical officer of the UN      The fees charged by the medical practitioners selected for the medical board are paid either by UNDP or partially by UNDP and partially by the staff member. If the original prognosis is altered in favour of the staff member, UNDP will bear all the medical fees and incidental expenses. However, if the original conclusion is sustained, the staff member bears the medical fees for the medical practitioner whom he/she selected and one-half of the medical fees and expenses of the third medical practitioner on the board. The balance of the fees and expenses are borne by UNDP.       Delay in determination      13. If a delay occurs in the determination by the UN Medical Director of the staff member’s incapacity and the staff member concerned has exhausted all his/her SL entitlement (at both full pay and half pay) under UN Staff Rule 6.2, and AL entitlement, the staff member will be placed on special leave with half pay pending the medical determination.       Request to UNJSPF       If the medical determination is that an impairment does exist, a request must be submitted as soon as possible to the United Nations Staff Pension Committee (“the Committee”) for the award of a disability benefit to the staff member.       The request must be submitted for:       Internationally recruited staff members, by the OHR Business Partner serving the duty station or organizational unit      Locally recruited staff members stationed outside New York, by the Deputy Resident Representative (Operations)      Locally recruited staff members stationed in New York, by the OHR Business Partner serving the organizational unit      The request must be submitted using the form Request for the Award of a Disability Benefit under Article 33 of the UNJSP Regulations.       Review by UNJSPF       The review of the UNJSPF Committee is governed by the UNJSPF Regulations and Rules. The UNJSPF Committee meets twice a year, normally in April and November.       Following consideration of the request and the advice of the UN Medical Director, the Committee will determine whether the staff member is incapacitated within the meaning of Article 33 (a) of the UNJSPF Regulations and, if a positive determination is made, will award a disability benefit. The Secretariat of the Pension Fund will notify both the staff member and the OHR Business Partner or Deputy Resident  Representative (Operations) of the Committee’s decision.       Delay in determination      19. If a delay occurs in the determination by the UNJSPF Committee of the award or non-award of a disability benefit and the staff member concerned has exhausted all his/her sick leave entitlement (at both full pay and half pay) under UN Staff Rule 6.2, as appropriate, and AL entitlement, the staff member will be placed on special leave with half pay pending the decision of the UNJSPF Committee.      Termination       General       Approving authority      20. The Administrator has the sole authority to terminate the appointment of any staff member. For termination of appointments for reasons of health, this authority has been delegated to the OHR Director.        Request to OHR Director       21. When the UNJSPF Committee has decided to award a disability benefit, a recommendation for the termination of the staff member’s appointment for reasons of health under UN Staff Regulation 9.3 (a) (iii) as appropriate, must be submitted as expeditiously as possible to the OHR Director for approval on behalf of the Administrator, for:      Internationally recruited staff members, by the OHR Business Partner serving the duty station or organizational unit      Locally recruited staff members stationed outside New York, by the Deputy Resident Representative (Operations)      Locally recruited staff members stationed in New York, by the OHR Business Partner serving the organizational unit      Notice of termination      Following the approval by the OHR Director of the termination of the staff member’s appointment, the appropriate notice of termination, as indicated in the next paragraph, will be issued to the staff members as follows:       For internationally recruited staff members, by the OHR Business Partner serving the duty station or organizational unit      For locally recruited staff members stationed outside New York, by the Head of Office      For locally recruited staff members stationed in New York, by the OHR Business Partner serving the organizational unit      Unless otherwise stipulated in the Letter of Appointment, a staff member must be given a notice of termination of not fewer than:       Three months, if under a Permanent Appointment   Three months, if under a Continuing Appointment   Thirty days, if under a Fixed-term Appointment   Fifteen days if under a Temporary Appointment      In lieu of the notice period, the Administrator may authorize compensation calculated on the basis of the net base salary and allowances that the staff member would have received had the date of termination been at the end of the notice period. In this event, the notice period is not:       Counted as contributory for pension purposes   Included in the calculation of length of service for payment of termination indemnity   Counted as service for the purpose of accrual of AL      Date of termination       25. Separation from service will take effect as of the date established in the notice of termination. In establishing such date, the following conditions will be observed:       If, on the date of notice, the staff member has a balance of SL that exceeds the period of notice prescribed in Staff Rule 9.7, the effective date of separation will be the date on which the staff member will have exhausted all his/her SL entitlement      If, on the date of notice, the staff member has a balance of SL that is less than the period of notice, the separation date will be the same as above, but the notice will advise the staff member that compensation in lieu of notice will be paid to the extent that the balance of SL falls short of the period of notice       If, on the date of notice, the staff member has already exhausted all his/her SL entitlement and has been placed on special leave with half pay under paragraph 13 and/or 19, the separation will be effective on the date the notice is given, but the notice will specify that compensation will be paid for the full period of notice      Termination indemnity       A staff member whose appointment is terminated for reasons of health and who receives compensation for total disability under UN Staff Rule 6.4, (i.e., injury or illness attributable to service), does not receive termination indemnity.      A staff member whose appointment is terminated for reasons of health, but who does not receive compensation for total disability under UN Staff Rule 6.4, receives a termination indemnity based on his/her contractual status and length of service as per Annexes II to the UN Staff Rules, minus the amount of any disability benefit that the staff member may receive from the UNJSPF for the number of months to which the indemnity rate corresponds.      Length of service comprises the total period of a staff member’s full-time continuous service with UNDP or with another organization of the UN common system, regardless of the type of appointment. Continuity of service will not be considered as broken by periods of special leave without pay (SLWOP) or with partial pay (SLWPP) for periods of less than one month, but full months of any such periods exceeding one calendar month will not be credited as service for indemnity purposes.       Reduction of indemnity      29. To avoid double compensation, the period of termination indemnity may not exceed the period before retirement age (60, 62 or 65). If so, indemnity is reduced for the number of months exceeding retirement age.       Calculation      The termination indemnity is calculated for:       Local staff members, based on the staff member’s pensionable remuneration, less staff assessment       International staff members, based on the staff member’s gross salary, less staff assessment      No pension contribution is made on the payment of a termination indemnity.       Other                      Sick Leave       Combination of SL on half pay with AL      32. Each day of SL at half pay may be combined with one-half day’s AL, provided the staff member previously agrees to such arrangement. In such case, a whole day’s SL on half pay and a half-day’s AL shall be charged for each working day involved.      Accrual of AL during SL      33. In accordance with UN Staff Rules 5.1 (a) and (c) as appropriate, a staff member will accrue AL:       While on SL with full-pay status;  or   While absent from work under an agreed arrangement, whereby a half day of AL is combined with a full day of SL at half pay      Accrual of other entitlements during SL      34. Periods of SL, whether on full or half pay, shall not affect the accrual of service credits towards salary increment, home leave (HL), termination indemnity, and repatriation grant (RG), except when a staff member’s fixed-term appointment is extended to enable him/her to use his/her SL entitlement (see the two paragraphs below).      Extension of fixed-term appointments for use of SL entitlement      When a staff member on a fixed-term appointment is incapacitated for service by reason of an illness that continues beyond the date of expiration of the appointment, he/she shall be granted an extension of the appointment, after consultation with the UN Medical Director, for a continuous period of certified illness up to the maximum entitlement to SL at full pay and half pay under UN Staff Rules 6.2.       When a staff member’s fixed-term appointment is extended solely to enable him/her to use his/her SL entitlement, such extension shall not give rise to any further entitlement to salary increment, AL, SL, or HL, but credit towards RG may continue to accrue if the staff member has not returned to his/her home country. SL on half pay during the period of such extension may not be supplemented by AL. In the event of death during the period of extension, the period prior to the death may be taken into account in the determination of the death benefit provided in UN Staff Rule 9.11 (a) (vii).    Confidentiality       37. Medical information is confidential and should be treated as such, whether within offices or in the transmission to the UN Medical Services Division (UNMSD). No copies of medical reports from attending physicians may be kept in the personal files of staff members.           ",
    "termination-appointment": "  Termination of Appointment  1.0           Regulations and Rules  This policy implements article IX of the UN Staff Regulations, and Chapter IX of the UN Staff Rules on Separation from Service.  2.0           Policy  This policy addresses the different types of termination of appointment and is applicable to all UNDP staff members governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.  Types of separation   For separations other than termination of appointment, please see UNDP’s Types of Separation   in the POPP.  Separation as a result of resignation, abandonment of post, expiration of appointment, retirement or death shall not be regarded as a termination within the meaning of the Staff Rules.  Termination of appointment   A termination of appointment is a separation from service initiated by the Organization (see UN Staff Regulation 9.3 and Staff Rule 9.6 for the purpose of:  ending the continuing or permanent appointment of a staff member prior to the mandatory age of separation; or  ending the temporary appointment or fixed-term appointment of a staff member prior to the date of expiration of the appointment.   The authority to terminate the appointment of any staff member rests with the Administrator or delegated official who, providing reasons for the action, may exercise this authority in accordance with the terms of a staff member’s appointment, in any of the following situations:  the necessities of service require the abolition of posts or the reduction of staff;  unsatisfactory service;  \t incapacity for further service for health reasons;   disciplinary reasons;   if facts anterior to the appointment have come to light that would have precluded the appointment;    termination in the interest of the good administration of the Organization, provided that the action is mutually agreed by the staff member and the Organization, which implies that the termination may not be contested by the staff member concerned (“agreed termination”);  in the case of a staff member holding a continuing appointment, termination in the interest of the Organization, without the agreement of the staff member, principally as the result of a change or termination of a mandate;   For staff members who become unassigned or return to UNDP without a specific lien on a position and who have been unable to secure a new position after a period of special leave without pay or from a loan or secondment with another UN Organization.   Termination of appointment for reasons of abolition of post or reduction of staff  The relocation of a post in the professional and higher categories to another duty station does not constitute an abolishment of post.    A notice of termination will be provided in writing to the staff member occupying a post which is being abolished. This includes a staff member who encumbers or maintains a return right to a specific post which is being abolished, and who is on any form of authorized leave, or on secondment or inter-agency loan.   In the case of staff members in the General Service and National Officer categories consideration for available and suitable posts will be limited to available and suitable posts at their duty station.  An “available post” is defined as a vacant UNDP post, or a post that is becoming vacant and is to be filled prior to the end of  the termination notice period. The funding source of the post may differ from that of the abolished post. An available post for purposes of this definition does not include temporary assignments or detail assignments, though it is recognized that performance of functions in such cases may suspend the termination of an appointment.  A post is “suitable” if staff members on an abolished post meet all the requirements and qualifications of a vacant post where their services can be effectively utilized, and have applied to or demonstrated specific and unequivocal documented interest in the relevant post.  If appointments are to be terminated as a result of the abolition of a post due to the reduction of staff, equally suitable staff members will be retained in the following order of preference:   staff members holding permanent appointments;   staff members holding continuing appointments;   staff members holding fixed-term appointments.   In the consideration of whether candidates are equally suitable, due regard shall be given to relative competence, integrity and length of service.   The effective date of separation is as follows:   For a staff member holding a permanent appointment, the separation date is the date of expiration of the notice period;   For a staff member holding a fixed-term appointment which expires after the end of the notice period, the separation date is the date of expiration of the notice period.    In the case of staff members on abolished posts, separation deferral options on special leave without pay , for a period up to and not exceeding two years, may be requested for the purposes of meeting the length of service requirements for pension or after service health insurance (ASHI).    Termination of appointment for unsatisfactory service  Managers must use the appropriate performance management tools in accordance with the relevant performance management and development policy to record unsatisfactory service, and to bring it to the attention of staff members in a timely manner, in order to offer staff members an opportunity to improve their performance.   If improvement in performance is not achieved in line with agreed expectations and within an agreed timeline, the appointment of the staff member may be terminated.  In the case of a staff member holding a permanent appointment that is proposed to be terminated for unsatisfactory service, the proposed action will be reviewed in accordance with Staff Rule 13.1(b)(i) by a body established for such review and which will make a recommendation to the Administrator or delegated official.  If no performance evaluation has been completed for a staff member holding a temporary appointment of six months or less, due to the short duration of the service, unsatisfactory performance can be attested to in writing, by the supervisor, and confirmed by the Bureau Director or Head of Office. Such a staff member may be separated for unsatisfactory service by terminating the appointment earlier, without further review.   In case of termination for unsatisfactory service, the staff member will be given notice according to the conditions applicable to their appointment type, or paid compensation in lieu of serving the notice period, at the discretion of the Administrator or delegated official.   A staff member whose appointment is terminated for unsatisfactory service may be paid a termination indemnity in accordance with Annex III, paragraph (c) of the Staff Regulations.    Termination for reasons of health  Please see UNDP’s policy on Termination of Appointment for Reasons of Health in the POPP.    Termination of appointment due to facts anterior to appointment  The Administrator or delegated official, may terminate the appointment of a staff member if facts anterior to the appointment, and relevant to the staff member’s suitability, come to light subsequent to appointment, and if those facts, had they been known, would have precluded the appointment.   Termination for disciplinary reasons  An appointment can be terminated for misconduct in accordance with the UNDP Legal Framework for Addressing Non-Compliance with the UN standards of conduct.    Termination of appointment in the interest of the good administration of the Organization (Mutually Agreed Termination)  The Administrator or delegated official may terminate the appointment of any staff member in the interest of the good administration of the Organization, and in accordance with the standards of the Charter, if mutually agreed by the staff member and the Administrator or  delegated official, and provided that the staff member concerned does not contest the action under specific conditions established by UNDP for mutually agreed terminations.   Any mutually agreed termination requires the staff member to sign a statement agreeing to the action and to not contest it.  In the case of a mutually agreed termination, separation deferral options and re-employment restrictions may apply. Such restrictions shall be stipulated in the termination agreement signed between the staff member and the Organization.  Upon termination of appointment, UNDP will pay the termination indemnity required under Annex III to the Staff Regulations. A mutually agreed termination may result in a different amount in accordance with UN Staff Regulation 9.3(d).  The approval of mutually agreed terminations remains a discretionary decision of UNDP and is not an entitlement. Factors considered in the approval of mutually agreed terminations include, among others, availability of funds, satisfactory service and the absence of a disciplinary record.  Consideration for additional termination indemnities  In cases where a staff member’s post has been abolished, where they become unassigned, where staff members have returned from their secondment as a Resident Coordinator, or in cases of mutually agreed termination, the Director of BMS may authorize a termination indemnity of up to 50 percent over and above what would be paid in accordance with Annex III to the UN Staff Regulations. The amount of additional termination indemnities which can be authorized by the Director of BMS is limited to, and calculated in accordance with, the schedule provided in Annex I.  In addition, the staff member must undertake in writing not to contest the action and meet the following criteria:  The staff member holds a permanent appointment, continuing appointment or fixed-term appointment and has completed 10 or more years of continuous service with UNDP. The period of 10 years or more includes time served by a staff member holding a permanent appointment, continuing appointment or fixed-term appointment who has transferred to UNDP from another organization of the UN Common System of Salaries and Allowances from a permanent, continuing or fixed-term appointment.  The following are not eligible for consideration for additional termination indemnities:  Staff members on temporary appointments;  Staff members who have less than 10 years of continuous service under a permanent, continuing or fixed-term appointment;  Staff members who have reached the mandatory age of separation;  Staff members who return to UNDP without a specific lien on a position and who have been unable to secure a new position after a period of special leave without pay or from a loan or secondment with another UN Organization, unless they were seconded as a Resident Coordinator or are separated on a mutually agreed termination;  Staff members who are separated from UNDP for misconduct or unsatisfactory service;  Staff members administered by UNDP on behalf of another UN agency or entity and staff members with appointments limited to another agency or entity, unless approved by the agency or entity;  Staff members on fixed term appointments who are appointed to positions with service limited to those positions;  United Nations Volunteers;  Personnel who serve under Personnel Services Agreements, Service Contracts and Individual Contracts.  At its discretion, the Organization may implement specific separation programmes as deemed necessary.  Notwithstanding the limitations listed in paragraph 30, above, the Organization may negotiate and enter into individual separation agreements with any category of staff member as deemed necessary to resolve individual workplace claims.   Implementation Options – lump sum/ special leave without pay  The termination indemnity is paid upon separation with a staff member’s final pay or as a lump sum combined with special leave without pay.   Calculation of termination indemnity  The termination indemnity is calculated:  for a locally recruited staff member: on the staff member’s gross salary, including language allowance, if any, less staff assessment;  for an internationally recruited staff member: the staff member’s gross salary less staff assessment and excluding post adjustment.  Length of service is the total period of a staff member’s full-time continuous service with UNDP, on a permanent appointment or fixed-term appointment including upon transfer from another organization of the UN Common System of Salaries and Allowances from a permanent appointment or fixed-term appointment.  Continuity of service is not considered broken by periods of special leave without pay or with partial pay, for less than 30 consecutive days, but full months will not be credited as service for indemnity purposes.  The termination indemnity is non-pensionable.  To avoid double compensation, the period for purposes of calculating the termination indemnity (including, where applicable, any additional termination indemnities paid in excess of what would be paid in accordance with Annex III to the UN Staff Regulations and payments in lieu of notice) cannot exceed the period left until the staff member would reach the mandatory age of separation.   No termination indemnity will be paid to a staff member who, upon separation from service, will receive a retirement benefit under article 28 of the Regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund or compensation for total disability under UN Staff Rule 6.4.    Funding of mutually agreed termination costs  A limited provision for funding such terminations is established within the Executive Group  approved Institutional Budget. The corporate provision is for all Bureaux, and hence its utilization will be subject to Bureaux forecasts within the current rules and governance. Such termination costs in excess of this limited corporate provision will be subject to a decision by the EG.    Notice of termination   If the Administrator or delegated official terminates an appointment, the staff member will be given the stipulated notice and any termination indemnity payments applicable under the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.   The following notice periods apply:  permanent and continuing appointment: no less than three months’ written notice;  fixed-term appointment: no less than 30 days written notice (or any other notice period stipulated in the letter of appointment);   temporary appointment: no less than 15 days written notice (or any other notice period stipulated in the letter of appointment).  The stipulated periods of notice are effective from the date of receipt of the written notification by the staff member.   In lieu of the statutory period of notice given to a staff member whose appointment is to be terminated, the Administrator or delegated official may instead decide to authorize compensation equivalent to salary, applicable post adjustment and allowances corresponding to the relevant notice period, at the rate in effect on the last day of service (“payment in lieu of notice”). If payment is made in lieu of notice, the notice period is not counted as time in service for any purpose.  Staff members serving their notice period who wish to leave the Organization before the end of the notice period may also have the remainder of the notice commuted to cash at the discretion of the Organization by submitting a written request to their supervisor upon receipt of the notice of termination. The authority to approve or deny the request is exercised by the Head of Office (in the case of locally recruited staff members serving outside New York Headquarters) or the Director, BMS/OHR (in the case of internationally recruited staff members and locally recruited staff members serving in New York Headquarters), taking into account the needs of the Organization, the supervisor’s recommendation, and the wishes of the staff member.    Re-Employment after Separation  A staff member whose appointment was terminated as a result of a mutually agreed termination may not be re-employed as a staff member within the period stipulated in the termination agreement.  Staff members re-employed following separation, under a new appointment, are not required to return their accrued annual leave, repatriation grant or normal termination indemnity payment.  However, any entitlement, benefit or accrual a staff member may have, will, when separated for a second time, be adjusted so that the total payments for the first and second separations do not exceed the amounts that would have been payable had the service been continuous (see UN Staff Rule 4.17 (b)). Staff members re-employed following separation from service, will have their entry on duty reset to the effective date of the new appointment.   A former staff member paid over and above what would be paid in accordance with Annex III to the UN Staff Regulations, may only be re-employed on a fixed-term appointment within a period of 12 months following the date of separation if the staff member returns the additional termination indemnity, unless otherwise stipulated in the termination agreement.   The provisions for engagement of a former staff member as personnel who were in service under Service Contracts, Personal Services Agreement, and Individual Contracts are contained in the POPP Section on Non Staff Contractual Modalities.    Certification of Service  Please see UNDP’s existing content on Certification of Service in the POPP.   Entitlements upon separation  Please see UNDPs existing content on Entitlements upon Separation in the POPP.         ANNEX I   The maximum amount of additional termination indemnities which can be offered is calculated in accordance with the following:     The amount of additional termination indemnities provided above is subject to periodic review and change.     ",
    "time-breastfeeding": "Time Off for Breastfeeding    The purpose of this policy is to enable staff members who are nursing mothers to breastfeed their infants upon returning to work, until the infant reaches two years of age.    Applicability     The policy applies to all staff members governed by the UN Staff Regulations and Staff Rules who are nursing mothers.     Conditions    In cases where a nursing mother brings her infant(s) to work, she may take time off to breastfeed whenever the infant demands. However, for security and workplace health and safety considerations, staff members are responsible for ensuring that their infants are not present in the office on a full-time continuous basis.      Staff members who are nursing mothers may leave the office up to two times a day to breastfeed their infant(s) or express milk outside the workplace. The maximum duration of absence for such purposes is:     Two hours away from the office (including travel time) when the infant is one year old or younger; or  One hour away from the office (including travel time) when the infant is between one and two years of age.  If a nursing mother has more than one breastfeeding infant, the maximum duration for leaving the office as specified above may be increased by up to 30 minutes for each additional infant.    If a staff member exceeds the allotted time off, they must make up the difference.   Breastfeeding while on duty travel  UNDP pays a lump sum to help cover the travel costs for breastfeeding infants who are under two years of age and who accompany their mothers on official duty travel. The lump sum per infant is equivalent to:   10 percent of the cost of the staff member’s ticket; plus 10 percent of the staff member’s Daily Subsistence Allowance.  No lump sum is paid for a babysitter or when a staff member travels to a non-family duty station.   The lump sum is charged to the same funding source covering the travel costs for the staff member and requested with the travel request. ",

The minimum standard of classification for the UN Clinic physician must be at the equivalent of the P3 level of internationally or locally recruited category on a staff appointment. A higher classification level may be applied on the basis of the expanded scope of the UN Clinics as approved by UNMSD. Management of the UN Clinic 12.  The UN Clinics operate, with regard to technical matters only, under the general supervision of the UN Medical Director.  While the UN Medical Services Division can be contacted 24/7, the professional guidance of the WHO Country Representative may be requested in emergency and until contact has been made with the UN Medical Director.  13. \tThe general management of the UN Clinic and its staff is the administrative responsibility of the UNDP Resident Representative. The UN Clinic Physician is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the UN Clinic. 14. \tThe UNCT is responsible for financing license access, any maintenance fees and training costs associated with the UN Medical Services approved electronic medical records management system.  Local Inter-Agency Clinic Management Committee (LIACMC) 15. \tA Local Inter-Agency Clinic Management Committee (LIACMC) must be established to assist the UNDP Resident Representative. Annex C contains sample Terms of Reference for a LIACMC.  16.\tThe LIACMC should be composed of at least the: a) \tWHO Representative, Chair b) \tUN Clinic Physician c) \tUNDP Deputy Resident Representative or Operations Manager  d) \tAn Operations Manager from a UN agency other than UNDP and WHO, to be nominated by the UN Operations Managers Team (OMT) for a period of one year; and e) \tA staff representative from a UN agency to be nominated by the chairs of UN System staff associations for a period of one year Procurement and Accounting Budget 17. \tCosts for the establishment and running of clinic facilities are shared among all UN agencies concerned.  Costs shall include not only the services, but also fees for facilities: renovation of buildings, acquisition and replacement of furniture and/ or equipment; drugs and medicines; rental of premises, if any; utilities; maintenance; and employee costs. Cost-sharing modalities and arrangements 18. \tThe administration of UN Clinics should be under the Common Services approach as defined by the UNSDG.  19.  Cost recovery for staff members and their eligible dependents through the medical insurance schemes may apply to primary clinical care and diagnostic tests required by clinical conditions, provided that the expenses for services are found to be reasonable and customary at the duty station and are normally reimbursable under a UN medical insurance plan (MIP) for staff or any approved insurance provider for other personnel. Where feasible, the UN Clinic, in consultation with the UN Medical Insurance Unit and UNMSD in New York is responsible for directly negotiating a direct billing arrangement with the relevant insurance providers for this purpose. The following occupational services are non-reimbursable from the insurance schemes: a)  \tMandatory and voluntary medical examinations b) \tTravel medicine c)  \tImmunization d)  \tHealth promotion e) \tWork-related injury  Storage and Inventory 20. \tThe premises where supplies and medicines are stored should be kept at the prescribed temperature, organized, and clean.  21.\tA simple automated inventory system must be established and maintained. Instructions contained in the UNDP Asset Management policies and procedures for inventory reporting procedures must be followed.   22. \tExcept where fee-for-service is charged to the users of the facility, all medications should normally be given to patients in limited quantities. To continue a course of treatment, medications should be purchased in a pharmacy through a prescription issued by the UN Clinic Physician and with the use of relevant medical insurance. If the UN Clinic physician is not licensed to prescribe in the respective country, a referral system to local, licensed physicians must be established. 23. \tUN Clinics must never stock any outdated medicines. Destruction of outdated medicine must be undertaken directly by the UN Clinic Physician, in consultation with the UN Medical Director through the UNDP Resident Representative. 24. \tA protocol for the disposal of expired medication, pathological waste, and sharps must be established following the official protocols of local health authorities and WHO guidance. The protocols should be explicit, in writing and openly displayed even when a third party provides this service.  Accounting 25. \tUN Clinics are run under a Common Services project to which all expenditures must be debited.  26. \tNo credits should accrue in the Common Services project.  The previous practice of charging fees or costs to the users of the facilities and crediting the Common Services project is no longer valid. 27. \tWhen a UN Clinic provides clinical services that are normally reimbursable under a medical insurance plan, including laboratory services and prescribed medications, the charges for such services may be reimbursed through the individual’s medical insurance, subject to the limitations under the plan.  28. \tPrescribed medications (especially longer-term treatments) readily available at adequate levels and standards within the country must be purchased at local pharmacies and charged against an individual's medical insurance plan.    Other Health-Related Services General Considerations 29. \tStaff members are entitled to receive free vaccines and inoculations that are compulsory or recommended by WHO at the duty stations.  Eligible dependents, though, are entitled to receive such vaccines and inoculations only in connection with official travel or in emergencies.  Yellow fever vaccination will be given at the UN Clinic and certified with the UN Clinic stamp.  The latest version of the WHO booklet ‘International Travel and Health’ should be available for the latest guidelines regarding potential health hazards to travellers.  30. \tFirst aid kits either for dressing wounds or with basic medications, which most Country Offices keep at hand, will continue to be provided directly by each respective agency. 31. \tStaff members may receive, by pouch and with the prior approval of the UN Medical Director, prescribed medicines that are not available locally.  The cost of medicines is incurred on an individual basis and should be settled directly by the staff member concerned.  Local Health Care Facilities  32.  The UN Clinic medical staff must be fully knowledgeable of the capabilities of the available local medical and dental facilities and must use these facilities to the greatest extent possible before reverting to medical evacuation. The UN Clinic Physician should regularly assess the referral medical facilities in order to update information. 33. \tUN Clinics should coordinate with local hospitals in order to facilitate admissions of UN staff members. Other UN Clinic Emergency Health Care Facilities 34.  If necessary, the UN Clinic Physician may establish emergency medical supply facilities in other duty stations within the country.  Emergency medical supplies will be properly stored at an easily accessible, secure place and will include a portion of a basic unit of the WHO new emergency health kit and some basic first aid material.  35. \tA first aid kit must always be present in every vehicle on field trips and on cross-line or cross-border missions.  The UN Clinic Physician should have adequate access to the emergency security communication of the UN in case of medical emergencies.  Other Closure of UN Clinic 36. \tThe closure of a UN Clinic is only permitted if UNMSD confirms that locally available medical facilities are adequate. Transition Measures 37. \tThe UN Clinics that are currently staffed with physicians on non-staff contracts including UN Volunteers (UNVs), Service Contract (SC) holders and Individual Contract (IC) holders, must, as of the effective date of this policy, take steps to regularize the contractual modality, at the appropriate approved level and in line with the provisions under section III of this policy. Current UN Clinics’ physicians that hold non-staff contracts will continue to serve until expiry of their contract. ",

The present document serves multiple purposes: It serves as a reminder to all staff members of their duty to abide by the highest standards of conduct. It defines the mechanisms that currently exist within UNDP for reporting allegations of wrongdoing, as well as what constitutes misconduct (Chapter I); It clarifies the responsibilities of each individual involved in the investigation of allegations of wrongdoing (Chapter II); It explains the procedure following investigation (Chapter III); It outlines the disciplinary procedure (Chapter IV). The present document supersedes: The Prescriptive Content on Accountability, Disciplinary Procedures and Measures issued in 2004;  Circular ADM/97/17 of 12 March 1997 entitled Accountability, Disciplinary Measures and Procedures;  Circular ADM/87/98 of 8 October 1987 entitled Establishment of the UNDP/UNFPA Disciplinary Committee;  Sections 10900 to 10903 and Section 10906 of the Personnel Manual for Locally Recruited Staff, and Sections 21100 to 21107 of the Personnel Manual for Internationally Recruited Staff; All previous versions of the UNDP Legal Framework for Addressing Non-compliance with UN Standards of Conduct (Legal Framework), of September 2007, November 2007, May 2008, January 2010, and March 2018. Section 2 - Definitions  For the purpose of the present document: Allegation of wrongdoing is the reasonable belief based on factual information that misconduct has occurred. Administrative leave is an exceptional status provided for by Staff Rule 10.4 in which a staff member may be suspended from performing his or her functions. A staff member may be placed on administrative leave, subject to conditions specified by the Administrator, at any time from the receipt of an allegation of misconduct and prior to the initiation of an investigation, through the course of an investigation until the completion of disciplinary proceedings as appropriate. Administrative leave can be with pay (ALWP), with partial pay or without pay (ALWOP).  BMS is the Bureau for Management Services. Clearance from the allegations of wrongdoing refers to the closure of the staff member’s case before disciplinary proceedings have been initiated.  Complainant is any person making a communication that discloses or demonstrates an intention to disclose information that misconduct may have occurred. Disciplinary action is the procedure initiated against a staff member pursuant to Staff Regulation 10.1, Chapter X of the Staff Rules, and Chapter IV of the present document. Duty of cooperation is the obligation imposed on staff members under Staff Regulation 1.2 (r) and Staff Rule 1.2 (c) to assist in an investigation, when requested to do so, by providing information in any form, including testimony, as relevant. Evidence is any type of proof which tends to establish or disprove a fact material to the case. It includes, but is not limited to, oral testimony of witnesses, including experts on technical matters, documents, electronic, audio, video records and photographs. Exoneration from allegations of wrongdoing refers to the closure of the staff member’s case after disciplinary proceedings have been initiated through the issuance of a charge letter to him or her. Financial Regulations and Rules refer to the UNDP Financial Regulations and Rules. Investigation is the process of planning and conducting appropriate lines of inquiry to determine the factual basis of allegations, and, if substantiated, assembling a dossier of evidence to permit a decision at a later stage as to whether formal charges of misconduct should be made against a staff member, or, whether the case should be closed.  Investigation participant is any person who is not the investigation subject but who cooperates with an investigation, for instance by being interviewed or by providing information. Investigation participants may be staff members cooperating pursuant to Staff Regulation 1.2 (r) and Staff Rule 1.2 (c), or non-staff and third persons who provide relevant information. Investigation subject or subject is a person who is the focus of the investigation, either by virtue of an allegation made, or evidence gathered during the course of an investigation. Investigator is a member of the Office of Audit and Investigations (OAI) or a person authorised by OAI to conduct an investigation related to cases of allegations of wrongdoing. An investigator may also be a person authorised directly by the Secretary-General or the Administrator in certain cases, to conduct an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing. BMS/OLS is the Office of Legal Services in the Bureau for Management Services. Manager is a staff member with a supervisory role. Misconduct is the failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and the Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant. Such a failure could be deliberate (intentional, or wilful act), or result from an extreme or aggravated failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonable person would have exercised with respect to a reasonably foreseeable risk (gross negligence) or from a complete disregard of a risk which is likely to cause harm (recklessness) (see Chapter I, Section 3).  OAI is the Office of Audit and Investigations. Organization is any entity of the UN system of Organizations with the authority to issue its own Letter of Appointment. BMS/OHR is the Office of Human Resources in the Bureau for Management Services. Assessment is the process of collecting, preserving and securing basic evidence, and the evaluation of this evidence to determine whether an investigation into reported allegations of wrongdoing is warranted. Staff members refer to the persons listed in Section 3, Subsection 3.1 below. Staff Regulations and Staff Rules refer to the United Nations Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.

CHAPTER I  STANDARDS OF CONDUCT  Section 1 - Standards of conduct expected from UNDP staff members  Staff members will uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. The concept of integrity enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations includes all aspects of behaviour of an international civil servant, including such qualities as honesty, truthfulness, impartiality and incorruptibility. Integrity is the most important among the core values of the Organization, together with professionalism and respect for diversity.  Staff members must abide by the Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service (referred to as the ‘ICSC Standards of Conduct’) as adopted by the International Civil Service Commission and most recently approved by the UN General Assembly in 2013, which updated the 1954 Code of Conduct of the United Nations staff members and by the standards defined in the Secretary-General’s Bulletin on “Special Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse”, ST/SGB/2003/13. Staff members can also refer to the Secretary-General’s Bulletin “Status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members”, ST/SGB/2016/9. This document contains a commentary by the Secretary-General to assist staff members and management in better understanding the obligations applicable to staff conduct. Section 2 - Management standards  In addition to complying with the above standards of conduct, managers will: Create and maintain a harmonious working environment, free of intimidation, hostility, offence and of any form of harassment and abuse of authority, and seek the informal resolution of interpersonal conflicts in the workplace, as appropriate, in accordance with the UNDP Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority; Communicate the policies protecting the rights of staff members, such as the UNDP Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority, as well as the present Legal Framework to all staff members, and ensure that staff members are aware of the contents of the Secretary-General’s Bulletin on “Special measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse”, ST/SGB/2003/13, and know where to turn in case they have concerns or want to make a report;  Ensure that managers, themselves, do not engage in any wrongdoing and do not create an intimidating, belittling, harassing work environment and/or demonstrate partiality, unfairness or favouritism;  Report allegations of wrongdoing to OAI as soon as they are aware of such allegations; Ensure that all discussion, communications and actions are handled with extreme sensitivity and utmost confidentiality; and  Ensure that no staff member is retaliated against.  As UNDP is committed to providing a harmonious working environment free of harassment, intimidation and favouritism, managers are expected to exhibit exemplary behaviour in their supervision of others. While issues of management style may not constitute misconduct warranting disciplinary action, it is the responsibility of supervisors, overseeing those managers found to be deficient in their treatment or supervision of people, to take appropriate action. In particular, supervisors should:  Take measures to coach or train managers in appropriate people management skills;  Reflect management issues in the annual PMD assessment;  As appropriate, issue letters of reprimand or take other non-disciplinary measures;  Take other action as appropriate. Supervisors will be held accountable for their failure to take appropriate action towards those managers whose management of others is found to be unsatisfactory.  Section 3 - Misconduct  Misconduct is defined in Staff Rule 10.1 as “failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant.” Such a failure could be deliberate (intentional or wilful act), or result from an extreme or aggravated failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonable person would have exercised with respect to a reasonably foreseeable risk (gross negligence) or from a complete disregard of a risk which is likely to cause harm (recklessness).  Misconduct may include, but is not limited to, the following categories whether wilful, reckless or grossly negligent:  Acts or omissions in conflict with the general obligations of staff members set forth in Article I of the Staff Regulations, Chapter I of the Staff Rules and other administrative issuances as applicable; failure to comply with the standards of conduct expected from international civil servants; Unlawful acts (e.g. theft, fraud, smuggling, possession or sale of illegal substances or objects, etc.) wherever they occur, and whether or not the staff member was officially on duty at the time; Assault, workplace harassment, including sexual harassment, or threats to other staff members or third parties (see the UNDP Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority ); Sexual exploitation and sexual abuse as defined in the Secretary-General’s Bulletin “Special measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse”, ST/SGB/2003/13; Misrepresentation, forgery, or false certification, including but not limited to, in connection with any official claim or benefit, the failure to disclose a fact material to that claim or benefit, or engaging in a knowing misrepresentation which has adverse consequences for the Organization;  Misuse or mishandling of official property, assets, equipment or files, including electronic files or data;  Action or omission to avoid or deviate from Financial Regulations, Rules and Procedures, including inappropriate use of authorizing, approving, committing or verifying authority;  Mishandling of contract obligations and relations with third parties leading to loss of property or assets, or generating liabilities for the Organization; Failure to disclose an interest or relationship with a third party who might benefit from a decision in which the staff member takes part; favouritism in the award of a contract to a third party; Breach of fiduciary obligations vis-à-vis the Organization; Misuse of office, abuse of authority; breach of confidentiality; abuse of United Nations privileges and immunities, including misuse of the United Nations Laissez-Passer; Exaction or acceptance of funds, services or benefits from a colleague or a third party in return for a favour or benefit; Failure to disclose promptly the receipt of gifts, remuneration or other benefits received from an external source by the staff member in connection with his or her official duties; Retaliatory action against a complainant or an investigation participant, or other action in violation of the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation; Making false accusations and disseminating false rumours; Direct or indirect use of, or attempt to use, official authority or influence of the staff member’s position or office for the purpose of obstructing an individual from reporting allegations of wrongdoing, or cooperating with an audit or an investigation; Abetting, concealing or conspiring in any of the above actions, including any act or omission bringing the Organization into disrepute. Unsatisfactory work performance, when it does not come to the level of gross negligence or recklessness, does not constitute misconduct and thus does not fall within the scope of the present document. Performance-related issues are to be addressed through the PMD assessment in accordance with the appropriate procedure (see the PMD policy and procedures).    Section 4 - Reporting allegations of wrongdoing   In reporting allegations of wrongdoing, staff members may make such a report either to OAI, or to their immediate supervisor or other appropriate supervisor within the operating unit. The staff member’s supervisor will report the matter to OAI in accordance with Section 2 of Chapter I. In the event that a staff member reports wrongdoing to OAI, he or she may do so anonymously by sending an e-mail at the following link: reportmisconduct@undp.org. In the event that the staff member believes that there is a conflict of interest on the part of the person to whom the allegations of wrongdoing are to be reported, he or she may report the allegations to the next higher level of authority.  In the event that the staff member fears retribution or retaliation after reporting allegations of wrongdoing, or cooperating with an audit or investigation, he or she may address his or her concern by filing a report to the Director, Ethics Office at the following email address: ethicsoffice@undp.org. The UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation applies in these cases. Other cases of retaliation that do not fall within the mandate of the Ethics Office as described in the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation, may be reported to OAI. If the allegations of wrongdoing relate to workplace harassment and abuse of authority, the Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority applies. Such allegations may be reported to OAI at the following link: reportmisconduct@undp.org. Staff members who become aware of information related to the Organization that concerns internet-based fraud, or misuse of the Organization database or technology resources, whether such information relates to sources within the Organization or externally, should report the matter. In such an event, Staff members should report the matter to OAI at  reportmisconduct@undp.org. Staff members can visit the following website for more information: https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/accountability/audit/office-of-audit-and-investigation.html. The website is public and external parties can also be directed to it.  Except when an allegation is made anonymously, the individual reporting the allegations will receive an acknowledgement from the office to which the allegations were reported.    CHAPTER II  INVESTIGATION   An investigation may involve the following parties:  The complainant(s); The investigation subject(s); The investigation participant(s); The investigator(s). The present Chapter II focuses on the rights and responsibilities of the investigation subjects in Section 1, the investigation participants in Section 2, the investigators in Section 3 and on the different phases of the investigation in Section 4. Section 1 - Roles, rights and responsibilities of the investigation subjects  1.1 - Rights of the investigation subjects  Provided that they have been identified by the investigators, the investigation subjects will be informed in writing of the allegations at the earliest possible time provided such disclosure does not put at risk the documentary evidence, investigation participants and/or any other individuals. However, the staff member must be notified no later than the start of his or her interview that he or she is the subject of the investigation. If the staff member has been placed on administrative leave (see Chapter II, Section 1, Subsection 1.3), this notification may happen prior to the commencement of the investigation.  If, in the course of the investigation, additional allegations are raised against the investigation subjects, the investigators will inform the subjects of these new allegations in the same manner as the earlier allegation(s), that is no later than the start of the subject’s interview on the matter of the additional allegation. However, the investigation subjects should be aware that BMS/OLS, after analysing the findings contained in OAI’s final investigation report, may decide that some facts as established by the investigation, though not initially raised as part of the original allegations of wrongdoing, may constitute misconduct. In such cases, the fact that OAI did not inform the subject of the alleged misconduct emerging from the investigation at the time of the investigation will not be considered a violation of procedure or due process rights, provided the investigation subjects are given the opportunity to comment on the charges levelled against them and the facts on which the charges are based (see Chapter III, Section 1, Subsection 1.1). If, during the course of the investigation, OAI discovers new facts giving rise to allegations of wrongdoing on the part of an investigation participant, OAI will notify the investigation participant, as soon as practicable and no later than the start of his or her interview, that he or she has become a subject of the investigation. In the event that, in the course of the investigation, additional allegations are raised against the investigation subjects, the provisions of paragraph 36 above will apply.  The identity of the investigation subjects should remain confidential to the extent possible within the legitimate needs of the investigation. However, these identities may become known, including to investigation participants in the context of the investigation. Investigation participants have a duty to keep the identities of investigation subjects confidential.   - Responsibilities of the investigation subjects   Pursuant to Staff Regulation 1.2 (r) and Staff Rule 1.2 (c), the investigation subjects must cooperate fully and in good faith with the investigators. They must not interfere with the investigation and must abstain from withholding, destroying or tampering with evidence, and from influencing, coaching or intimidating the complainant    and/or investigation participants. The subject must respect the confidential nature of the investigation and the proceedings by exercising outmost discretion. A lack of cooperation and/or undue interference with the investigation may constitute misconduct and may result in disciplinary or other appropriate action. 1.3 - Administrative leave  Pursuant to Staff Rule 10.4, a staff member may be placed on administrative leave by the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS at any time from the moment allegations of wrongdoing are reported or detected, pending or during an investigation and until the completion of the disciplinary process. Placement of a staff member on administrative leave is normally with pay, unless exceptional circumstances warrant administrative leave without pay or with partial pay. In either case, the administrative leave is without prejudice to the staff member’s rights and it does not constitute a disciplinary measure.  As a general principle, administrative leave with pay may be contemplated in cases where: The conduct in question and/or the continued presence of the staff member on UN premises poses or may pose a security or financial risk to the Organization and/or its personnel, including the staff member concerned, or otherwise prejudice the Organization’s interests or reputation;  The staff member is unable to continue performing his or her functions effectively, in view of the ongoing investigation or proceedings, and the nature of his or her functions;  Continued service by the staff member would create a risk that he or she may destroy, conceal or otherwise tamper with potential evidence, or interfere in any way with the investigation or disciplinary process, including retaliation against individuals protected under the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation or intimidation of a witness;  The staff member’s continued presence at the office could negatively impact the preservation of a harmonious work environment; There is a risk of a repetition or continuation of the alleged misconduct. Administrative leave without pay may be contemplated in cases where: On the basis of the information before him or her, there is preponderance of evidence that the staff member engaged in the alleged conduct and the alleged misconduct is of such gravity that it would, if established, warrant separation or dismissal under Staff Rule 10.2 (a) (viii) or (ix);  There is prima facie evidence of allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse. Requests for placement of a staff member on administrative leave at either the assessment stage or the investigation stage should be addressed to the Director, BMS/OLS. On the basis of the evidence presented, the Director, BMS/OLS may recommend to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS that an individual be placed on administrative leave. Resident Representatives in Country Offices, Heads of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau in Headquarters and other locations and the Executive Director of the Organization to which the holder of a UNDP letter of appointment is assigned, do not have the authority to place staff members on administrative leave.  Exceptionally, if the Resident Representative or the Head of Office/Unit/Section/ Department/Bureau considers that the circumstances require immediate action, he or she may decide to place the staff member on special leave with full pay (SLWFP); he or she cannot place the staff member on special leave without pay (SLWOP). If the Resident Representative or the Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau places the staff member on SLWFP, he or she must inform the Director, BMS/OLS within 72 hours of his or her decision to place the staff member on SLWFP and provide all the relevant evidence documenting why placement on SLWFP was urgently required and could not wait for formal authorization of administrative leave to be granted. After review of the case, the Director, BMS/OLS will make a recommendation to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS concerning whether administrative leave is justified:  If the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS considers that administrative leave is warranted, the SLWFP will be converted into administrative leave and the decision to place the staff member on administrative leave will supersede the staff member’s placement on SLWFP;  If the administrative leave is not warranted, the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS will revoke the decision to place the staff member on SLWFP.  The Resident Representative or the Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau is accountable if he or she improperly places a staff member on administrative leave or SLWFP under the present Legal Framework, or does not report his or her action in this respect within the prescribed timeframe.  If the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS authorizes the placement of a staff member on administrative leave, the staff member will:  Be notified in writing of the reason(s) for being placed on administrative leave, of its probable duration and of its conditions;   Immediately surrender his or her grounds pass and/or United Nations Laissez-Passer; and   Immediately surrender any UNDP property or assets he or she may have, when requested.  Placement of a staff member on administrative leave will not exceed three months at a time. Subject to the justification provided by the Director, BMS/OLS to support an extension of the administrative leave, the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS may extend the administrative leave for a further defined period not exceeding three months. There is no limit to the cumulative time a staff member may be on administrative leave, but the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS will try to limit the time on administrative leave as much as possible and to this extent, alternatives to administrative leave such as a change in functions, reporting, training or a detail assignment, may be decided. The Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS may consult with the Director, BMS/OHR and/or Director, BMS/OLS on the application of such measures.  A staff member placed on administrative leave must surrender his or her grounds pass and any United Nations Laissez-Passer and return any United Nations owned equipment which has been assigned to him or her. While on administrative leave, a staff member will not  be allowed to enter the Organization’s office premises without first obtaining written permission from the Resident Representative, or Head of the relevant office. Such entry will be under escort and in connection with the staff member’s defence of the case or other valid reason justifying such entrance. Normally, the staff member placed on administrative leave is not be precluded from remaining at, or returning to, the duty station. Special consideration should be made for staff residing in the Organization’s compound. A staff member placed on administrative leave must obtain the written approval of the Resident Representative or Head of the relevant office before leaving the duty station during the period of administrative leave. Should the staff member placed on administrative leave request or, under exceptional circumstances, be requested to leave the duty station, he or she must immediately provide his or her contact information, including telephone number(s), personal e-mail address(es) and current residential address so that he or she may be contacted during the investigation. Such information must be updated by the staff member if the contact details change. The staff member placed on administrative leave has a duty to remain available for the investigation.   The staff member placed on administrative leave may make a request to the Director, BMS/OLS to be granted access to files, provided that he or she justifies that the files are relevant to his or her case, and provided that access will not be disruptive to UNDP operations or access otherwise needs to be restricted (such as where the staff member requests information that is confidential or privileged). The Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS will decide in each case whether the staff member placed on administrative leave will or will not be given access to e-mail. Section 2 - Roles, rights and responsibilities of the investigation participants  2.1 - Responsibilities of the investigation participants  Pursuant to Staff Regulation 1.2 (r) and Staff Rule 1.2 (c), staff members, including investigation participants, must cooperate fully and in good faith with a duly authorized investigation.  The investigation participants must refrain from discussing or disclosing the investigation or their testimony to anyone except the investigators. In no case should an investigation participant discuss with the investigation subject and/or complainant and/or another investigation participant the nature of the evidence requested or provided, or testimony given to investigators. 2.2 - Investigation participant’s identity  Requests for confidentiality by investigation participants will be honoured to the extent possible within the legitimate needs of the investigation. In certain cases (e.g. workplace harassment and abuse of authority), however, the identity of the complainant and/or other investigation participants may need to be shared with the investigation subject for purposes of due process. In addition, those identities may become known for reasons outside the control of the investigators.  2.3 - Protection against retaliation  Anyone who cooperates in good faith with an investigation is entitled to protection from retaliation in accordance with the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation. However, cooperation with the investigation does not excuse the individual’s own possible complicity in the underlying matter. Notwithstanding his or her cooperation, a staff member may face disciplinary proceedings for his or her part in the matter about which he or she is cooperating with the investigators, and such proceedings may result in the imposition of disciplinary sanctions. Neither the investigation, institution of disciplinary proceedings, nor the imposition of disciplinary sanctions for his or her complicity in the underlying matter about which the staff member is cooperating, constitute retaliatory action.  Section 3 - Roles, rights and responsibilities of the investigators  All investigators, or persons authorised to conduct an assessment or an investigation, will be independent. They have a duty of objectivity, thoroughness, ethical behaviour, and observance of legal and professional standards. Investigations should be launched only after an assessment establishes that the allegation, if true, could constitute misconduct and is accompanied by information specific enough to be investigated, or has, or directly points to corroborating documentary or testamentary evidence that can be pursued. In carrying out investigations, the OAI investigators or persons authorised by OAI to investigate are to be guided by the OAI Investigation Guidelines. However, such guidelines reflect practice and are not binding or mandatory on OAI, and the failure to observe the Guidelines does not necessarily constitute a due process violation. Section 4 - Assessment and/or investigation  The investigative process may comprise two phases: an assessment and an investigation. In all instances, OAI retains the prerogative to determine when circumstances warrant an assessment and/or an investigation, and in conformity with the present document, the appropriate investigative process to be followed. 4.1 - Assessment  The purpose of an assessment is: To record and establish the basic facts;  To preserve or secure basic evidence whether written or electronic (such as cheques, invoices, written statements, or other relevant documents, records or data) that might otherwise be lost and that may be necessary for the determination as to whether an investigation is justified; To identify any inconsistencies or outstanding questions; and To analyse the evidence to determine whether an investigation into reported allegations of wrongdoing is justified. In country offices, the Resident Representative or his or her delegated authority should contact OAI as soon as possible when he or she has received sufficient information about the existence of wrongdoing by staff or other individuals whether in the form of specific allegations; facts or circumstances suggesting wrongdoing has occurred; or loss, damage to property or apparent impropriety. In Headquarters and other locations, the same provision applies to Heads of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau.  At the request of OAI and under its guidance, the Resident Representative or delegated authority or Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau may initiate an assessment into any suspected wrongdoing. Where OAI has requested that an assessment be carried out, and the assessment indicates that wrongdoing may have occurred, those conducting the assessment will report this conclusion to the Director, OAI, giving a full account of the facts that are known and attaching documentary evidence if appropriate. Should placement of the staff member on administrative leave appear to be warranted, a recommendation to such effect may be made to the Director, BMS/OLS (see Chapter II, Section 1, Subsection 1.3), so that a decision can be taken by the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS, as soon as practicable. However, the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS can decide on the placement on administrative leave on his or her own initiative where the circumstances warrant. Where the assessment does not generate sufficient information to indicate that wrongdoing has occurred, OAI will close the case, and inform BMS/OLS and the complainant accordingly. 4.2 - Investigation  On the basis of the evidence collected and any assessment, OAI will decide whether to proceed with a further investigation. The Director, OAI, may refer the matter to persons he or she designates, depending on the nature of the allegations and the complexity of the case.  The decision to conduct an investigation is not an accusation. The outcome of the investigation may or may not support a conclusion that misconduct was committed and, if so, by whom. When OAI designates investigators outside OAI, they must seek and follow guidance from OAI as to the conduct of the investigation. Investigation subjects must be interviewed in the course of the investigation. A recording of the interview will be made, and OAI will inform the staff member that the interview is being recorded. A transcript of the interview record will be included as an exhibit of the investigation report and will be shared with the subject as part of the investigation report. In addition, investigation subjects may choose to provide a signed statement containing any clarification on their statements during the interviews; however, they cannot change their statements as recorded by OAI’s recording devices. The loss or corruption of the recording of the interview with the subject alone cannot serve as a basis to invalidate the investigation or the investigation report. Where a subject cannot be interviewed for reasons beyond the control of the investigators, the absence of such an interview will not be considered a violation of the subject’s due process rights as long as reasonable efforts were made to interview the subject.  Investigation subjects, or complainants in cases relating to allegations of sexual exploitation or sexual harassment, can request to be accompanied to their interview by an observer who is either a UNDP staff member or an immediate family member, provided that the observer is readily available and not involved in the investigation, as determined by OAI. The observer must agree to respect the confidentiality of the investigation and sign a confidentiality statement. The observer may not interrupt, prevent or delay the interview, and is not allowed to speak during the interview. If the investigator considers the presence of the observer disruptive, the observer may be asked to leave and the interview will proceed without the observer. Considering the cultural context, gender, and other elements of the case, the investigator may also select an observer (e.g. field security officer, etc.) to attend the interview. Investigation subjects and participants have no right to the presence of counsel during interviews. 4.3 - Investigation report The investigator(s) will prepare a draft investigation report giving a full account of the relevant facts that are known and attaching any documentary evidence. OAI will share the draft investigation report with the investigation subject, along with the transcript of the interview and other exhibits and request that the investigation subject provide his or her comments on the factual findings and conclusions of the report, and produce countervailing evidence, if any. In individual cases where time is of the essence and the main facts are not disputed, following consultation with the Director, BMS/OLS, the Director, OAI may decide to forward the draft investigation report directly to BMS/OLS without obtaining the subject’s comments. In such cases, the relevant provisions of the Introduction and Chapters II, III, IV and V will continue to apply mutatis mutandis. OAI will request that the subject of the investigation respond within a reasonable period of time, normally ten (10) calendar days. If no response is submitted within the time limit, the matter will nevertheless proceed without the subject’s comments.  Where OAI receives comments from the subject on the draft investigation report, OAI will consider the comments, including any additional evidence he or she provides in support of those comments, and determine whether they merit any revision to the draft investigation report. OAI is not obligated to obtain comments on the draft investigation report from the investigation subject more than once, but may, at its discretion, revert to the investigation subject for clarification regarding the comments and evidence he or she presented in response to the draft investigation report.  Once the Director, OAI considers that no further revision to the draft investigation report is warranted, OAI will provide the final investigation report, together with the comments of the investigation subject and any evidence he or she may have provided, to the Director, BMS/OLS. If the investigation subject resigns or otherwise separates prior to the completion by OAI of an investigation report, at its discretion, OAI may decide to complete the investigation or finalize the investigation report notwithstanding the investigation subject’s resignation or separation: Should the investigation report be finalised, OAI will send the draft investigation report to the former staff member providing the subject an opportunity to submit his or her comments. These comments will be reviewed in accordance with the present Legal Framework, and the Director, BMS/OLS will place a letter in the former staff member’s official status file indicating whether, if the subject had remained employed: (1) a recommendation would have been made for charges of misconduct to be initiated against him or her, or (2) whether or not he or she would have been cleared of the allegations of misconduct, or (3) whether the matter would have been dealt with from a work performance standpoint, and if so how (e.g. via a letter of reprimand). The letter will also indicate whether the former staff member resigned while under investigation, or whether his or her contract expired while under investigation. The former staff member will be invited to comment on the letter, and the letter and his or her comments will be placed in his or her official status file. Should the investigation report not be finalised, the Director, BMS/OLS will place a letter in the former staff member’s official status file, indicating that he or she: (1) resigned or, (2) his or her contract expired while under investigation. In both instances, the former staff member will be given an opportunity to present comments, and the letter and his or her comments will be placed in his or her official status file. If the subject transfers, or otherwise separates and accepts a position at the UN Secretariat or an Agency, Fund or Programme of the UN prior to the completion of the investigation report, the Director, OAI may decide to transfer the matter to that UN entity. If the subject of an investigation resigns or otherwise separates from service after the issuance of an investigation report but prior to the initiation of disciplinary proceedings through the issuance of a charge letter, upon review of the investigation report and the comments of the subject thereon, the Director BMS/OLS may decide to place a letter in the former staff member’s official status file indicating whether, if he or she had remained employed: (1) a recommendation would have been made for charges of misconduct to be initiated against him or her, or (2) whether or not he or she would have been cleared of the allegations of misconduct, or (3) whether the matter would have been dealt with from a work performance standpoint, and if so how (e.g. via a letter of reprimand). The letter will also indicate whether the former staff member resigned or otherwise separated following an investigation. The former staff member will be invited to comment on the letter, and the letter and his or her comments will be placed in his or her official status file. If the subject transfers, or otherwise separates and accepts a position at the UN Secretariat or an Agency, Fund or Programme of the UN, the Director, BMS/OLS may decide to transfer the matter to that UN entity. The foregoing is without prejudice to the fact that in accordance with the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation, OAI will forward the report of an investigation that was conducted based on a prima facie finding of the Director, Ethics Office, to the Director, Ethics Office, without obtaining prior comment on the report by the subject of the investigation. However, any staff members alleged to be responsible for retaliation will enjoy the same rights as other subjects of investigation, including, consistent with the procedures for investigation, the ability to comment on any draft investigation report concerning allegations against them as the investigation subject.  CHAPTER III  PROCEDURES FOLLOWING INVESTIGATION  Section 1 - Actions following receipt of the final investigation report by BMS/OLS   Upon receipt and analysis by BMS/OLS of the final investigation report and the comments of the subject of the investigation on the draft investigation report, including any additional evidence he or she may have provided, the Director, BMS/OLS, may request that OAI or the subject of the investigation provide further clarification or verification prior to making a recommendation on the next course of action.  On the basis of a review of the final investigation report, and any comments and evidence presented by the investigation subject thereon, as well as any additional clarification or verification by OAI or the subject of the investigation, the Director, BMS/OLS, may recommend the following actions to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS:   1.1 - Charges of misconduct   If the Director, BMS/OLS considers that the facts indicate that misconduct occurred, he or she will recommend that the staff member be formally charged with misconduct.  The charge letter initiates the disciplinary proceedings. In that letter (which will attach the final investigation report and the comments of the subject of the investigation on the draft investigation report, including any additional evidence he or she may have provided) the staff member is notified in writing of the formal charges (which at his or her request may be translated into the working language of his or her duty station), and be given a specified period of time (normally at least ten (10) working days) to answer the charges and produce countervailing evidence, if any. The staff member will also be notified of his or her right to counsel to assist in his or her defence, and be informed as to how to obtain the assistance of the Office of Staff Legal Assistance (see Chapter IV, Section 4). The investigation subject may present a request to the Director, BMS/OLS, that he or she be granted access to files, provided that he or she justifies that they are relevant to his or her response. A copy of the charge letter signed by the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS may be given for information to the Resident Representative, Head of Office/Unit/Section/ Department/Bureau, or the Executive Director of the Organization to which the staff member is assigned. The Director, BMS/OLS, may, on an exceptional basis, grant an extension to the staff member to respond to the charges of misconduct. Any request by the staff member should be accompanied by specific reasons for such an extension. If the investigation subject resigns or otherwise separates from service after the initiation of disciplinary proceedings but prior to the completion of the case and imposition of a disciplinary sanction, the Director, BMS/OLS may nevertheless decide to proceed, and seek to obtain the comments of the subject or consider the comments already received as appropriate. Upon receipt of the comments of the subject or an indication that the subject does not wish to provide comments or if the subject does not provide comments within the prescribed period, the Director, BMS/OLS  may conclude the matter as follows: The Director, BMS/OLS may determine that, if the subject had remained a staff member, a recommendation would have been made to impose disciplinary sanctions on the subject. The Director BMS/OLS may place a letter to this effect on the subject’s official status file. The letter will also indicate that the subject resigned or otherwise separated from service following the issuance of a charge letter. The subject will be invited to comment on the letter, and his or her comments will be attached to the letter from the Director BMS/OLS to be placed in his or her official status file; or The Director, BMS/OLS may determine that, had the subject remained a staff member, a recommendation would have been made to exonerate the subject without further consequences, or to exonerate the subject and treat the matter as a performance issue. In such a case, such a recommendation will be made to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS who may formally and fully exonerate the subject or exonerate the subject and issue a reprimand. Should the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS determine that the subject should not be exonerated, the matter will proceed as in (a); or If the subject transfers, or otherwise separates and accepts a position at the UN Secretariat or an Agency, Fund or Programme of the UN, the Director, BMS/OLS may decide to transfer the matter to that UN entity; or Otherwise close the matter without further action. 1.2 - Clearance from the allegations of wrongdoing  If the Director, BMS/OLS considers that the allegations are not substantiated or the facts do not warrant disciplinary action, he or she will recommend to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS:  That the staff member be notified in writing that they have been cleared of the allegations of wrongdoing, and that the matter be closed; OAI and the Resident Representative, Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau, or the Executive Director of the Organization to which the staff member is assigned, will be informed of such notification;  If the staff member was placed on administrative leave, that the administrative leave be discontinued and that the staff member be authorized to resume his or her duties; and That documents related to the investigation be expunged from the staff member’s official status file, except those referred to in Chapter III, Section 1, Subsection 1.3. The staff member will be notified in writing as soon as feasible of the decision of the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS concerning his or her exoneration.  1.3 - Work performance related issues  While the Director, BMS/OLS may recommend that the subject be cleared of the allegations of wrongdoing, he or she may determine that the conduct depicted in the final investigation report as received by BMS/OLS and the circumstances of the case have shown unsatisfactory performance and/or poor judgement not amounting to misconduct on the part of the staff member. In such a case, the Director, BMS/OLS may recommend that: An oral reprimand or letter of reprimand be issued by the Assistant Administrator and Director, Bureau for Management Services. In such an instance, further or additional comments on the basis of the reprimand do not need to be obtained provided the staff member has had the opportunity to comment on the facts and circumstances on which the reprimand is based (such as by being provided an opportunity to comment on the draft investigation report); and/or  The final investigation report (or extracts thereof) with the staff member’s comments thereon, be included in the annual Performance Management and Development (PMD) of the staff member; and/or An appropriate training course be undertaken by the staff member. 1.4 - Timeframe  To the extent possible, depending on the complexity of a case and the availability of investigative resources, the period between the date the allegations of wrongdoing are reported to OAI and the completion of the investigation should not normally exceed 270 working days. The timeframe from receipt of the final investigation report by BMS/OLS to the finalization of the case should not normally exceed 180 working days.    CHAPTER IV  DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS   The dispatch of a letter outlining the legal charges of misconduct against the subject initiates disciplinary proceedings. Disciplinary proceedings cannot proceed until the subject has been provided with such a letter. Upon receipt of the subject’s comments to the charges, the Director, BMS/OLS will consider whether the subject’s conduct constitutes misconduct within the meaning of Staff Rule 10.1, or whether the subject has given a satisfactory account of his or her behaviour and should be exonerated of the charges of misconduct. In the latter case, the Director, BMS/OLS may also consider whether the circumstances indicate the need to address the conduct of the subject as a performance issue. Should the Director, BMS/OLS consider that the subject’s conduct constitutes misconduct, he or she will make a recommendation to the Administrator with a copy to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS as to the appropriate measure or measures, taking into account, inter alia, relevant case law and precedents. Where the Director, BMS/OLS considers that the subject has given a satisfactory account of his or her behaviour and the subject’s conduct does not rise to the level of misconduct, the Director, BMS/OLS makes a recommendation to this effect to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS, who has authority to decide on the exoneration of a subject of allegations of misconduct. Section 1 - Disciplinary measures  In accordance with Staff Rule 10.2 (a), where the subject’s conduct constitutes misconduct, the Administrator or Associate Administrator may impose one or more of the following disciplinary measures on the subject, depending on the nature and gravity of the misconduct in question: Written censure; Loss of one or more steps in grade; Deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for salary increment; Suspension without pay for a specified period; Fine; Deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for consideration for promotion; Demotion with deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for consideration for promotion; Separation from service, with notice or compensation in lieu of notice, notwithstanding Staff Rule 9.7, and with or without termination indemnity pursuant to paragraph (c) of Annex III to the Staff Regulations; Dismissal.   Annex I to the present document specifies the effects of each of the above-mentioned measures.  The Administrator or Associate Administrator will notify the subject of the decision to impose a disciplinary sanction in writing. The Director, BMS/OHR and the Resident Representative, Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau, or the Executive Director of the Organization to which the subject is assigned, will also be informed of such notification. A copy of the decision will be placed on the subject’s official status file. Section 2 – Exoneration and Non-disciplinary measures Where the conduct of the subject is not considered to rise to the level of misconduct, the subject is exonerated of the allegations of misconduct. The decision of the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS to that effect will be provided in writing to the subject. The Director, BMS/OHR and the Resident Representative, Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau, or the Executive Director of the Organization to which the subject is assigned, will also be informed of such a decision. Notwithstanding the exoneration of the subject of allegations of misconduct, the conduct of the subject may require other administrative action and/or measures. These do not constitute disciplinary sanctions. Under Staff Rule 10.2 (b), the following measures are not considered to be disciplinary measures: Written or oral reprimand; Recovery of monies owed to the Organization; Administrative leave with or without pay pursuant to Staff Rule 10.4. Other measures may be taken such as recovery of monies from the subject as a result of a failure to comply with his or her private legal obligations in accordance with the findings of a competent court, specific training to improve or further develop certain skills or the temporary reassignment to different, but equivalent-level, functions. Such measures do not constitute a disciplinary measure. The recovery for any financial loss attributable to the staff member’s conduct, including gross negligence or recklessness pursuant to Staff Rule 10.1 (b) may be pursued in addition to the imposition of disciplinary measures (see Chapter IV, Section 5, Subsection 5.3). Section 3 - Appeal against a disciplinary measure to the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal  Within ninety (90) calendar days of being informed of the decision taken in his or her case, a subject against whom a disciplinary or non-disciplinary measure has been imposed following the completion of the disciplinary proceedings, may submit an application to the United Nations Dispute Tribunal, in accordance with Chapter XI of the Staff Rules. A staff member or the Organization may appeal against a decision or judgement of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal to the United Nations Appeals Tribunal within sixty (60) calendar days from the issuance of the judgement on grounds set out in Staff Rule 11.5.  Section 4 - Counsel to staff member  Representation by Counsel is permitted once the staff member is charged with misconduct and during disciplinary proceedings.    4.1 - Office of Staff Legal Assistance, United Nations  A staff member, who wishes to obtain the assistance of the Office of Staff Legal Assistance, may contact this Office at e-mail: osla@un.org, or telephone number: (+1) 212- 963-3957.   4.2 - External counsel  Alternatively, if a staff member chooses to secure Counsel from outside the Office of Staff Legal Assistance, it will be at his or her own expense (see Staff Rule 10.3 (a)).  Section 5 - Miscellaneous  5.1 - Publication of disciplinary decisions  In the interests of transparency, the Administrator will inform the UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS Executive Board of disciplinary decisions taken in the course of the preceding year, and publish an annual report of cases of misconduct (without the individuals’ names) that have resulted in the imposition of disciplinary measures. Such report will be circulated to all staff.  5.2 - Local authorities  It should be noted that the Organization is obligated to refer credible allegations of violations of national law to the country of nationality of the staff member. Referral may also be made to the national authorities in the country where the events in question took place. Such referral will usually occur following disciplinary proceedings, but may occur at any time that credible allegations are considered to arise.  Staff members may not report any matters to local authorities except in the case of compelling emergency or an imminent threat or danger, after which the matter will be immediately reported to BMS/OLS. Otherwise, any such matters must first be reported to BMS/OLS. Bringing a matter to the attention of local authorities requires the concurrence of the UN Office of Legal Affairs (UN/OLA) since it, inter alia, implicates the privileges and immunities of the Organization.  5.3 - Recovery for Loss of Property or Assets  Under Staff Rule 10.1 (b), “Where the staff member’s failure to comply with his or her obligations or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant is determined by the Secretary-General to constitute misconduct, such staff member may be required to reimburse the United Nations either partially or in full for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of his or her actions, if such actions are determined to be willful, reckless, or grossly negligent.”  Pursuant to that Rule, UNDP will pursue recovery for any financial loss attributable to the staff member’s misconduct (fraud, theft), or gross negligence, or recklessness, in the management of funds.  Such recovery action does not constitute a disciplinary measure (see Staff Rule 10.2 (b)) and is distinct from any disciplinary action being considered or undertaken.   ANNEX I:  EFFECTS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF DISCIPLINARY MEASURES  The following disciplinary measures may be taken into account when assessing the staff member’s performance.  Written censure  A written censure is a letter indicating that the staff member has committed wrongdoing. The written censure is placed in the staff member’s official status file and becomes part of his or her permanent record.  Loss of one or more steps-in-grade  Loss of steps-in-grade means that the staff member’s level within grade is reduced by the number of steps specified in the decision. As a result, the staff member loses any accrued period of service within the year the decision is implemented. He or she will be eligible for subsequent in-grade increments on the anniversary date of the implementation of the disciplinary decision.  In the event that the number of steps to be lost is greater than the staff member’s current step, he or she is placed at the lowest step on the salary scale for his or her grade, and remains at that step for the number of years by which the decision exceeds the number of steps available before receiving the next increment on the scale.   Deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for salary increment  Deferment of eligibility for salary increment means that for the stated time period of the deferment, the staff member’s step is frozen, and, for that period, he or she does not accrue any time to be credited towards eligibility for the next salary increment. In this instance, the anniversary date upon which the staff member would be eligible for the next salary increment is postponed for a period of time corresponding to the length of the deferment, and all future anniversary dates upon which the staff member becomes eligible for salary increments will change accordingly. Any period of service occurring between the date of the staff member’s last salary increment and the implementation date of the deferment measure will be credited towards the staff member’s next salary increment.        Suspension without pay for a specified period  Suspension without pay means that the staff member is not permitted to serve for a specified period of time, which normally does not exceed six months, during which his or her salary and allowances are withheld and any contribution which UNDP is paying in respect of medical insurance and pension is discontinued.  Fine  The staff member is assessed a monetary penalty, the amount of which is determined in proportion to his or her annual remuneration. The fine is either paid directly by the staff member or deducted from his or her emoluments in a lump-sum or schedule of payments.   Deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for consideration for promotion  Deferment of eligibility for consideration for promotion means that for the stated time period of the deferment, the staff member cannot be considered for promotion to any posts.  Demotion with deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for consideration for promotion  Demotion means a reduction in grade, normally the staff member’s immediate grade below, unless the decision provides for a demotion by more than one grade. Demotion is implemented as the opposite of a promotion. As a result, the staff member is placed at the equivalent step to his or her current step in the grade below his or her present grade. However, the Administrator or Associate Administrator as appropriate may vary the step level. If the demotion is effective in the month in which an increment at the higher step is due, such increment is implemented, and the above subtraction is effected on the basis of the new step.   The demotion decision will specify the period of time during which the staff member will not be eligible and considered for promotion.  The date of the next salary increment at the lower level becomes the anniversary date of the demotion.   Separation from service, with notice or compensation in lieu of notice, notwithstanding Staff Rule 9.7, and with or without termination indemnity pursuant to paragraph (c) of Annex III to the Staff Regulations  The decision will specify whether the separation from service is: with notice or compensation in lieu thereof, and  with or without termination indemnity.  The termination notice or compensation in lieu thereof, will not be less than three months for permanent appointments and continuing appointments, not less than thirty (30) days for fixed-term appointments, and not less than fifteen (15) days for temporary appointments, or such period as may be stipulated in the letter of appointment.  In lieu of the serving of the notice period, the UNDP Administrator may authorize payment of compensation on the basis of the salary and allowances which would have been payable if the date of termination had been at the end of the notice period. In such a case, all salaries, allowances and other benefits which the staff member would have received had he or she served the period of notice, are taken into account, including post adjustment, dependency allowances, special post allowances, education grant, etc. The period is counted in the calculation of terminal payments, but annual leave does not continue to accrue. The salary paid in lieu of notice is not pensionable and the period is not counted as contributory service. Unless the staff member requests that it be excluded, any contribution which UNDP is paying in respect of medical insurance is continued during the period of notice.  If the staff member is granted termination indemnity, this indemnity does not exceed half of the amount calculated pursuant to Annex III to the Staff Regulations.  Subject to the conditions of eligibility, a staff member separated from service is entitled to repatriation grant.   A staff member separated from service for misconduct is banned from any future employment and contractual opportunities with the Organization.  Dismissal  Dismissal means immediate separation from service.  A staff member who is dismissed is neither entitled to termination notice or compensation in lieu thereof, nor to any termination indemnity pursuant to Annex III to the Staff Regulations, nor to repatriation grant pursuant to Staff Rule 3.18.  A staff member who is dismissed is banned from any future employment and contractual opportunities with the Organization.  _________________      Links to Documents  The relevant documents cited in the UNDP Legal Framework for Addressing Non-compliance with UN Standards of Conduct can be accessed through the following links:  Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service  Secretary-General’s Bulletin on “Status, basic rights and duties of UN Staff Members” (ST/SGB/2016/9)   Secretary-General’s Bulletin on “Special Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse” (ST/SGB/2003/13)  UNDP Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority  UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation  Performance Management and Development (PMD) Policy  OAI Investigation Guidelines   ",

The present document serves multiple purposes: It serves as a reminder to all staff members of their duty to abide by the highest standards of conduct. It defines the mechanisms that currently exist within UNDP for reporting allegations of wrongdoing, as well as what constitutes misconduct (Chapter I); It clarifies the responsibilities of each individual involved in the investigation of allegations of wrongdoing (Chapter II); It explains the procedure following investigation (Chapter III); It outlines the disciplinary procedure (Chapter IV). The present document supersedes: The Prescriptive Content on Accountability, Disciplinary Procedures and Measures issued in 2004;  Circular ADM/97/17 of 12 March 1997 entitled Accountability, Disciplinary Measures and Procedures;  Circular ADM/87/98 of 8 October 1987 entitled Establishment of the UNDP/UNFPA Disciplinary Committee;  Sections 10900 to 10903 and Section 10906 of the Personnel Manual for Locally Recruited Staff, and Sections 21100 to 21107 of the Personnel Manual for Internationally Recruited Staff; All previous versions of the UNDP Legal Framework for Addressing Non-compliance with UN Standards of Conduct (Legal Framework), of September 2007, November 2007, May 2008, January 2010, and March 2018. Section 2 - Definitions  For the purpose of the present document: Allegation of wrongdoing is the reasonable belief based on factual information that misconduct has occurred. Administrative leave is an exceptional status provided for by Staff Rule 10.4 in which a staff member may be suspended from performing his or her functions. A staff member may be placed on administrative leave, subject to conditions specified by the Administrator, at any time from the receipt of an allegation of misconduct and prior to the initiation of an investigation, through the course of an investigation until the completion of disciplinary proceedings as appropriate. Administrative leave can be with pay (ALWP), with partial pay or without pay (ALWOP).  BMS is the Bureau for Management Services. Clearance from the allegations of wrongdoing refers to the closure of the staff member’s case before disciplinary proceedings have been initiated.  Complainant is any person making a communication that discloses or demonstrates an intention to disclose information that misconduct may have occurred. Disciplinary action is the procedure initiated against a staff member pursuant to Staff Regulation 10.1, Chapter X of the Staff Rules, and Chapter IV of the present document. Duty of cooperation is the obligation imposed on staff members under Staff Regulation 1.2 (r) and Staff Rule 1.2 (c) to assist in an investigation, when requested to do so, by providing information in any form, including testimony, as relevant. Evidence is any type of proof which tends to establish or disprove a fact material to the case. It includes, but is not limited to, oral testimony of witnesses, including experts on technical matters, documents, electronic, audio, video records and photographs. Exoneration from allegations of wrongdoing refers to the closure of the staff member’s case after disciplinary proceedings have been initiated through the issuance of a charge letter to him or her. Financial Regulations and Rules refer to the UNDP Financial Regulations and Rules. Investigation is the process of planning and conducting appropriate lines of inquiry to determine the factual basis of allegations, and, if substantiated, assembling a dossier of evidence to permit a decision at a later stage as to whether formal charges of misconduct should be made against a staff member, or, whether the case should be closed.  Investigation participant is any person who is not the investigation subject but who cooperates with an investigation, for instance by being interviewed or by providing information. Investigation participants may be staff members cooperating pursuant to Staff Regulation 1.2 (r) and Staff Rule 1.2 (c), or non-staff and third persons who provide relevant information. Investigation subject or subject is a person who is the focus of the investigation, either by virtue of an allegation made, or evidence gathered during the course of an investigation. Investigator is a member of the Office of Audit and Investigations (OAI) or a person authorised by OAI to conduct an investigation related to cases of allegations of wrongdoing. An investigator may also be a person authorised directly by the Secretary-General or the Administrator in certain cases, to conduct an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing. BMS/OLS is the Office of Legal Services in the Bureau for Management Services. Manager is a staff member with a supervisory role. Misconduct is the failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and the Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant. Such a failure could be deliberate (intentional, or wilful act), or result from an extreme or aggravated failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonable person would have exercised with respect to a reasonably foreseeable risk (gross negligence) or from a complete disregard of a risk which is likely to cause harm (recklessness) (see Chapter I, Section 3).  OAI is the Office of Audit and Investigations. Organization is any entity of the UN system of Organizations with the authority to issue its own Letter of Appointment. BMS/OHR is the Office of Human Resources in the Bureau for Management Services. Assessment is the process of collecting, preserving and securing basic evidence, and the evaluation of this evidence to determine whether an investigation into reported allegations of wrongdoing is warranted. Staff members refer to the persons listed in Section 3, Subsection 3.1 below. Staff Regulations and Staff Rules refer to the United Nations Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.  Section 3 - Scope of application  3.1 - To whom the present document applies  The present document applies to: All staff members holding UNDP letters of appointment, including Junior Professional Officers (JPOs), regardless of whether their assignment is with UNDP, or on a UNDP Letter of Appointment with service limited to another Organization, Department, Programme or Fund.

However, the present document does not apply in certain circumstances during a period of secondment or an inter-organization movement governed by the receiving Organization’s Rules (see paragraph 7 (a));  Staff members of other Organizations on secondment to UNDP or on an \ninter-organization movement with UNDP, for actions occurring during their secondment or inter-organization movement. In such a case, UNDP will inform the releasing Organization prior to charging a staff member with misconduct.  For holders of UNDP letters of appointment who are subject to an inter-organization movement pursuant to the Inter-Organization Agreement concerning Transfer, Secondment or Loan of Staff among the Organizations applying the UN Common System of Salaries and Allowances (Inter-Organization Agreement), the Inter-Organization Agreement and any memoranda pursuant to it, will determine the respective prerogatives of the releasing and the receiving Organization with regard to disciplinary action.  3.2 - To whom the present document does not apply  The present document does not apply to: UNDP staff members on an inter-organization movement to a UN Agency for acts that occurred during their inter-organization movement to that Agency. However, disciplinary action under the present document may be initiated upon the UNDP staff member’s return; Individuals who do not have a UNDP letter of appointment;  Independent contractors working with UNDP under an Individual Contractor modality (IC); Persons employed under Service Contracts (SC);  UNV Volunteers (UNVs); Interns.

CHAPTER I  STANDARDS OF CONDUCT  Section 1 - Standards of conduct expected from UNDP staff members  Staff members will uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. The concept of integrity enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations includes all aspects of behaviour of an international civil servant, including such qualities as honesty, truthfulness, impartiality and incorruptibility. Integrity is the most important among the core values of the Organization, together with professionalism and respect for diversity.  Staff members must abide by the Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service (referred to as the ‘ICSC Standards of Conduct’) as adopted by the International Civil Service Commission and most recently approved by the UN General Assembly in 2013, which updated the 1954 Code of Conduct of the United Nations staff members and by the standards defined in the Secretary-General’s Bulletin on “Special Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse”, ST/SGB/2003/13. Staff members can also refer to the Secretary-General’s Bulletin “Status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members”, ST/SGB/2016/9. This document contains a commentary by the Secretary-General to assist staff members and management in better understanding the obligations applicable to staff conduct. Section 2 - Management standards  In addition to complying with the above standards of conduct, managers will: Create and maintain a harmonious working environment, free of intimidation, hostility, offence and of any form of harassment and abuse of authority, and seek the informal resolution of interpersonal conflicts in the workplace, as appropriate, in accordance with the UNDP Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority; Communicate the policies protecting the rights of staff members, such as the UNDP Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority, as well as the present Legal Framework to all staff members, and ensure that staff members are aware of the contents of the Secretary-General’s Bulletin on “Special measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse”, ST/SGB/2003/13, and know where to turn in case they have concerns or want to make a report;  Ensure that managers, themselves, do not engage in any wrongdoing and do not create an intimidating, belittling, harassing work environment and/or demonstrate partiality, unfairness or favouritism;  Report allegations of wrongdoing to OAI as soon as they are aware of such allegations; Ensure that all discussion, communications and actions are handled with extreme sensitivity and utmost confidentiality; and  Ensure that no staff member is retaliated against.  As UNDP is committed to providing a harmonious working environment free of harassment, intimidation and favouritism, managers are expected to exhibit exemplary behaviour in their supervision of others. While issues of management style may not constitute misconduct warranting disciplinary action, it is the responsibility of supervisors, overseeing those managers found to be deficient in their treatment or supervision of people, to take appropriate action. In particular, supervisors should:  Take measures to coach or train managers in appropriate people management skills;  Reflect management issues in the annual PMD assessment;  As appropriate, issue letters of reprimand or take other non-disciplinary measures;  Take other action as appropriate. Supervisors will be held accountable for their failure to take appropriate action towards those managers whose management of others is found to be unsatisfactory.  Section 3 - Misconduct  Misconduct is defined in Staff Rule 10.1 as “failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant.” Such a failure could be deliberate (intentional or wilful act), or result from an extreme or aggravated failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonable person would have exercised with respect to a reasonably foreseeable risk (gross negligence) or from a complete disregard of a risk which is likely to cause harm (recklessness).  Misconduct may include, but is not limited to, the following categories whether wilful, reckless or grossly negligent:  Acts or omissions in conflict with the general obligations of staff members set forth in Article I of the Staff Regulations, Chapter I of the Staff Rules and other administrative issuances as applicable; failure to comply with the standards of conduct expected from international civil servants; Unlawful acts (e.g. theft, fraud, smuggling, possession or sale of illegal substances or objects, etc.) wherever they occur, and whether or not the staff member was officially on duty at the time; Assault, workplace harassment, including sexual harassment, or threats to other staff members or third parties (see the UNDP Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority ); Sexual exploitation and sexual abuse as defined in the Secretary-General’s Bulletin “Special measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse”, ST/SGB/2003/13; Misrepresentation, forgery, or false certification, including but not limited to, in connection with any official claim or benefit, the failure to disclose a fact material to that claim or benefit, or engaging in a knowing misrepresentation which has adverse consequences for the Organization;  Misuse or mishandling of official property, assets, equipment or files, including electronic files or data;  Action or omission to avoid or deviate from Financial Regulations, Rules and Procedures, including inappropriate use of authorizing, approving, committing or verifying authority;  Mishandling of contract obligations and relations with third parties leading to loss of property or assets, or generating liabilities for the Organization; Failure to disclose an interest or relationship with a third party who might benefit from a decision in which the staff member takes part; favouritism in the award of a contract to a third party; Breach of fiduciary obligations vis-à-vis the Organization; Misuse of office, abuse of authority; breach of confidentiality; abuse of United Nations privileges and immunities, including misuse of the United Nations Laissez-Passer; Exaction or acceptance of funds, services or benefits from a colleague or a third party in return for a favour or benefit; Failure to disclose promptly the receipt of gifts, remuneration or other benefits received from an external source by the staff member in connection with his or her official duties; Retaliatory action against a complainant or an investigation participant, or other action in violation of the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation; Making false accusations and disseminating false rumours; Direct or indirect use of, or attempt to use, official authority or influence of the staff member’s position or office for the purpose of obstructing an individual from reporting allegations of wrongdoing, or cooperating with an audit or an investigation; Abetting, concealing or conspiring in any of the above actions, including any act or omission bringing the Organization into disrepute. Unsatisfactory work performance, when it does not come to the level of gross negligence or recklessness, does not constitute misconduct and thus does not fall within the scope of the present document. Performance-related issues are to be addressed through the PMD assessment in accordance with the appropriate procedure (see the PMD policy and procedures).    Section 4 - Reporting allegations of wrongdoing   In reporting allegations of wrongdoing, staff members may make such a report either to OAI, or to their immediate supervisor or other appropriate supervisor within the operating unit. The staff member’s supervisor will report the matter to OAI in accordance with Section 2 of Chapter I. In the event that a staff member reports wrongdoing to OAI, he or she may do so anonymously by sending an e-mail at the following link: reportmisconduct@undp.org. In the event that the staff member believes that there is a conflict of interest on the part of the person to whom the allegations of wrongdoing are to be reported, he or she may report the allegations to the next higher level of authority.  In the event that the staff member fears retribution or retaliation after reporting allegations of wrongdoing, or cooperating with an audit or investigation, he or she may address his or her concern by filing a report to the Director, Ethics Office at the following email address: ethicsoffice@undp.org. The UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation applies in these cases. Other cases of retaliation that do not fall within the mandate of the Ethics Office as described in the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation, may be reported to OAI. If the allegations of wrongdoing relate to workplace harassment and abuse of authority, the Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority applies. Such allegations may be reported to OAI at the following link: reportmisconduct@undp.org. Staff members who become aware of information related to the Organization that concerns internet-based fraud, or misuse of the Organization database or technology resources, whether such information relates to sources within the Organization or externally, should report the matter. In such an event, Staff members should report the matter to OAI at  reportmisconduct@undp.org. Staff members can visit the following website for more information: https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/accountability/audit/office-of-audit-and-investigation.html. The website is public and external parties can also be directed to it.  Except when an allegation is made anonymously, the individual reporting the allegations will receive an acknowledgement from the office to which the allegations were reported.    CHAPTER II  INVESTIGATION   An investigation may involve the following parties:  The complainant(s); The investigation subject(s); The investigation participant(s); The investigator(s). The present Chapter II focuses on the rights and responsibilities of the investigation subjects in Section 1, the investigation participants in Section 2, the investigators in Section 3 and on the different phases of the investigation in Section 4. Section 1 - Roles, rights and responsibilities of the investigation subjects  1.1 - Rights of the investigation subjects  Provided that they have been identified by the investigators, the investigation subjects will be informed in writing of the allegations at the earliest possible time provided such disclosure does not put at risk the documentary evidence, investigation participants and/or any other individuals. However, the staff member must be notified no later than the start of his or her interview that he or she is the subject of the investigation. If the staff member has been placed on administrative leave (see Chapter II, Section 1, Subsection 1.3), this notification may happen prior to the commencement of the investigation.  If, in the course of the investigation, additional allegations are raised against the investigation subjects, the investigators will inform the subjects of these new allegations in the same manner as the earlier allegation(s), that is no later than the start of the subject’s interview on the matter of the additional allegation. However, the investigation subjects should be aware that BMS/OLS, after analysing the findings contained in OAI’s final investigation report, may decide that some facts as established by the investigation, though not initially raised as part of the original allegations of wrongdoing, may constitute misconduct. In such cases, the fact that OAI did not inform the subject of the alleged misconduct emerging from the investigation at the time of the investigation will not be considered a violation of procedure or due process rights, provided the investigation subjects are given the opportunity to comment on the charges levelled against them and the facts on which the charges are based (see Chapter III, Section 1, Subsection 1.1). If, during the course of the investigation, OAI discovers new facts giving rise to allegations of wrongdoing on the part of an investigation participant, OAI will notify the investigation participant, as soon as practicable and no later than the start of his or her interview, that he or she has become a subject of the investigation. In the event that, in the course of the investigation, additional allegations are raised against the investigation subjects, the provisions of paragraph 36 above will apply.  The identity of the investigation subjects should remain confidential to the extent possible within the legitimate needs of the investigation. However, these identities may become known, including to investigation participants in the context of the investigation. Investigation participants have a duty to keep the identities of investigation subjects confidential.   - Responsibilities of the investigation subjects   Pursuant to Staff Regulation 1.2 (r) and Staff Rule 1.2 (c), the investigation subjects must cooperate fully and in good faith with the investigators. They must not interfere with the investigation and must abstain from withholding, destroying or tampering with evidence, and from influencing, coaching or intimidating the complainant    and/or investigation participants. The subject must respect the confidential nature of the investigation and the proceedings by exercising outmost discretion. A lack of cooperation and/or undue interference with the investigation may constitute misconduct and may result in disciplinary or other appropriate action. 1.3 - Administrative leave  Pursuant to Staff Rule 10.4, a staff member may be placed on administrative leave by the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS at any time from the moment allegations of wrongdoing are reported or detected, pending or during an investigation and until the completion of the disciplinary process. Placement of a staff member on administrative leave is normally with pay, unless exceptional circumstances warrant administrative leave without pay or with partial pay. In either case, the administrative leave is without prejudice to the staff member’s rights and it does not constitute a disciplinary measure.  As a general principle, administrative leave with pay may be contemplated in cases where: The conduct in question and/or the continued presence of the staff member on UN premises poses or may pose a security or financial risk to the Organization and/or its personnel, including the staff member concerned, or otherwise prejudice the Organization’s interests or reputation;  The staff member is unable to continue performing his or her functions effectively, in view of the ongoing investigation or proceedings, and the nature of his or her functions;  Continued service by the staff member would create a risk that he or she may destroy, conceal or otherwise tamper with potential evidence, or interfere in any way with the investigation or disciplinary process, including retaliation against individuals protected under the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation or intimidation of a witness;  The staff member’s continued presence at the office could negatively impact the preservation of a harmonious work environment; There is a risk of a repetition or continuation of the alleged misconduct. Administrative leave without pay may be contemplated in cases where: On the basis of the information before him or her, there is preponderance of evidence that the staff member engaged in the alleged conduct and the alleged misconduct is of such gravity that it would, if established, warrant separation or dismissal under Staff Rule 10.2 (a) (viii) or (ix);  There is prima facie evidence of allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse. Requests for placement of a staff member on administrative leave at either the assessment stage or the investigation stage should be addressed to the Director, BMS/OLS. On the basis of the evidence presented, the Director, BMS/OLS may recommend to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS that an individual be placed on administrative leave. Resident Representatives in Country Offices, Heads of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau in Headquarters and other locations and the Executive Director of the Organization to which the holder of a UNDP letter of appointment is assigned, do not have the authority to place staff members on administrative leave.  Exceptionally, if the Resident Representative or the Head of Office/Unit/Section/ Department/Bureau considers that the circumstances require immediate action, he or she may decide to place the staff member on special leave with full pay (SLWFP); he or she cannot place the staff member on special leave without pay (SLWOP). If the Resident Representative or the Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau places the staff member on SLWFP, he or she must inform the Director, BMS/OLS within 72 hours of his or her decision to place the staff member on SLWFP and provide all the relevant evidence documenting why placement on SLWFP was urgently required and could not wait for formal authorization of administrative leave to be granted. After review of the case, the Director, BMS/OLS will make a recommendation to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS concerning whether administrative leave is justified:  If the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS considers that administrative leave is warranted, the SLWFP will be converted into administrative leave and the decision to place the staff member on administrative leave will supersede the staff member’s placement on SLWFP;  If the administrative leave is not warranted, the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS will revoke the decision to place the staff member on SLWFP.  The Resident Representative or the Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau is accountable if he or she improperly places a staff member on administrative leave or SLWFP under the present Legal Framework, or does not report his or her action in this respect within the prescribed timeframe.  If the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS authorizes the placement of a staff member on administrative leave, the staff member will:  Be notified in writing of the reason(s) for being placed on administrative leave, of its probable duration and of its conditions;   Immediately surrender his or her grounds pass and/or United Nations Laissez-Passer; and   Immediately surrender any UNDP property or assets he or she may have, when requested.  Placement of a staff member on administrative leave will not exceed three months at a time. Subject to the justification provided by the Director, BMS/OLS to support an extension of the administrative leave, the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS may extend the administrative leave for a further defined period not exceeding three months. There is no limit to the cumulative time a staff member may be on administrative leave, but the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS will try to limit the time on administrative leave as much as possible and to this extent, alternatives to administrative leave such as a change in functions, reporting, training or a detail assignment, may be decided. The Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS may consult with the Director, BMS/OHR and/or Director, BMS/OLS on the application of such measures.  A staff member placed on administrative leave must surrender his or her grounds pass and any United Nations Laissez-Passer and return any United Nations owned equipment which has been assigned to him or her. While on administrative leave, a staff member will not  be allowed to enter the Organization’s office premises without first obtaining written permission from the Resident Representative, or Head of the relevant office. Such entry will be under escort and in connection with the staff member’s defence of the case or other valid reason justifying such entrance. Normally, the staff member placed on administrative leave is not be precluded from remaining at, or returning to, the duty station. Special consideration should be made for staff residing in the Organization’s compound. A staff member placed on administrative leave must obtain the written approval of the Resident Representative or Head of the relevant office before leaving the duty station during the period of administrative leave. Should the staff member placed on administrative leave request or, under exceptional circumstances, be requested to leave the duty station, he or she must immediately provide his or her contact information, including telephone number(s), personal e-mail address(es) and current residential address so that he or she may be contacted during the investigation. Such information must be updated by the staff member if the contact details change. The staff member placed on administrative leave has a duty to remain available for the investigation.   The staff member placed on administrative leave may make a request to the Director, BMS/OLS to be granted access to files, provided that he or she justifies that the files are relevant to his or her case, and provided that access will not be disruptive to UNDP operations or access otherwise needs to be restricted (such as where the staff member requests information that is confidential or privileged). The Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS will decide in each case whether the staff member placed on administrative leave will or will not be given access to e-mail. Section 2 - Roles, rights and responsibilities of the investigation participants  2.1 - Responsibilities of the investigation participants  Pursuant to Staff Regulation 1.2 (r) and Staff Rule 1.2 (c), staff members, including investigation participants, must cooperate fully and in good faith with a duly authorized investigation.  The investigation participants must refrain from discussing or disclosing the investigation or their testimony to anyone except the investigators. In no case should an investigation participant discuss with the investigation subject and/or complainant and/or another investigation participant the nature of the evidence requested or provided, or testimony given to investigators. 2.2 - Investigation participant’s identity  Requests for confidentiality by investigation participants will be honoured to the extent possible within the legitimate needs of the investigation. In certain cases (e.g. workplace harassment and abuse of authority), however, the identity of the complainant and/or other investigation participants may need to be shared with the investigation subject for purposes of due process. In addition, those identities may become known for reasons outside the control of the investigators.  2.3 - Protection against retaliation  Anyone who cooperates in good faith with an investigation is entitled to protection from retaliation in accordance with the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation. However, cooperation with the investigation does not excuse the individual’s own possible complicity in the underlying matter. Notwithstanding his or her cooperation, a staff member may face disciplinary proceedings for his or her part in the matter about which he or she is cooperating with the investigators, and such proceedings may result in the imposition of disciplinary sanctions. Neither the investigation, institution of disciplinary proceedings, nor the imposition of disciplinary sanctions for his or her complicity in the underlying matter about which the staff member is cooperating, constitute retaliatory action.  Section 3 - Roles, rights and responsibilities of the investigators  All investigators, or persons authorised to conduct an assessment or an investigation, will be independent. They have a duty of objectivity, thoroughness, ethical behaviour, and observance of legal and professional standards. Investigations should be launched only after an assessment establishes that the allegation, if true, could constitute misconduct and is accompanied by information specific enough to be investigated, or has, or directly points to corroborating documentary or testamentary evidence that can be pursued. In carrying out investigations, the OAI investigators or persons authorised by OAI to investigate are to be guided by the OAI Investigation Guidelines. However, such guidelines reflect practice and are not binding or mandatory on OAI, and the failure to observe the Guidelines does not necessarily constitute a due process violation. Section 4 - Assessment and/or investigation  The investigative process may comprise two phases: an assessment and an investigation. In all instances, OAI retains the prerogative to determine when circumstances warrant an assessment and/or an investigation, and in conformity with the present document, the appropriate investigative process to be followed. 4.1 - Assessment  The purpose of an assessment is: To record and establish the basic facts;  To preserve or secure basic evidence whether written or electronic (such as cheques, invoices, written statements, or other relevant documents, records or data) that might otherwise be lost and that may be necessary for the determination as to whether an investigation is justified; To identify any inconsistencies or outstanding questions; and To analyse the evidence to determine whether an investigation into reported allegations of wrongdoing is justified. In country offices, the Resident Representative or his or her delegated authority should contact OAI as soon as possible when he or she has received sufficient information about the existence of wrongdoing by staff or other individuals whether in the form of specific allegations; facts or circumstances suggesting wrongdoing has occurred; or loss, damage to property or apparent impropriety. In Headquarters and other locations, the same provision applies to Heads of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau.  At the request of OAI and under its guidance, the Resident Representative or delegated authority or Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau may initiate an assessment into any suspected wrongdoing. Where OAI has requested that an assessment be carried out, and the assessment indicates that wrongdoing may have occurred, those conducting the assessment will report this conclusion to the Director, OAI, giving a full account of the facts that are known and attaching documentary evidence if appropriate. Should placement of the staff member on administrative leave appear to be warranted, a recommendation to such effect may be made to the Director, BMS/OLS (see Chapter II, Section 1, Subsection 1.3), so that a decision can be taken by the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS, as soon as practicable. However, the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS can decide on the placement on administrative leave on his or her own initiative where the circumstances warrant. Where the assessment does not generate sufficient information to indicate that wrongdoing has occurred, OAI will close the case, and inform BMS/OLS and the complainant accordingly. 4.2 - Investigation  On the basis of the evidence collected and any assessment, OAI will decide whether to proceed with a further investigation. The Director, OAI, may refer the matter to persons he or she designates, depending on the nature of the allegations and the complexity of the case.  The decision to conduct an investigation is not an accusation. The outcome of the investigation may or may not support a conclusion that misconduct was committed and, if so, by whom. When OAI designates investigators outside OAI, they must seek and follow guidance from OAI as to the conduct of the investigation. Investigation subjects must be interviewed in the course of the investigation. A recording of the interview will be made, and OAI will inform the staff member that the interview is being recorded. A transcript of the interview record will be included as an exhibit of the investigation report and will be shared with the subject as part of the investigation report. In addition, investigation subjects may choose to provide a signed statement containing any clarification on their statements during the interviews; however, they cannot change their statements as recorded by OAI’s recording devices. The loss or corruption of the recording of the interview with the subject alone cannot serve as a basis to invalidate the investigation or the investigation report. Where a subject cannot be interviewed for reasons beyond the control of the investigators, the absence of such an interview will not be considered a violation of the subject’s due process rights as long as reasonable efforts were made to interview the subject.  Investigation subjects, or complainants in cases relating to allegations of sexual exploitation or sexual harassment, can request to be accompanied to their interview by an observer who is either a UNDP staff member or an immediate family member, provided that the observer is readily available and not involved in the investigation, as determined by OAI. The observer must agree to respect the confidentiality of the investigation and sign a confidentiality statement. The observer may not interrupt, prevent or delay the interview, and is not allowed to speak during the interview. If the investigator considers the presence of the observer disruptive, the observer may be asked to leave and the interview will proceed without the observer. Considering the cultural context, gender, and other elements of the case, the investigator may also select an observer (e.g. field security officer, etc.) to attend the interview. Investigation subjects and participants have no right to the presence of counsel during interviews. 4.3 - Investigation report The investigator(s) will prepare a draft investigation report giving a full account of the relevant facts that are known and attaching any documentary evidence. OAI will share the draft investigation report with the investigation subject, along with the transcript of the interview and other exhibits and request that the investigation subject provide his or her comments on the factual findings and conclusions of the report, and produce countervailing evidence, if any. In individual cases where time is of the essence and the main facts are not disputed, following consultation with the Director, BMS/OLS, the Director, OAI may decide to forward the draft investigation report directly to BMS/OLS without obtaining the subject’s comments. In such cases, the relevant provisions of the Introduction and Chapters II, III, IV and V will continue to apply mutatis mutandis. OAI will request that the subject of the investigation respond within a reasonable period of time, normally ten (10) calendar days. If no response is submitted within the time limit, the matter will nevertheless proceed without the subject’s comments.  Where OAI receives comments from the subject on the draft investigation report, OAI will consider the comments, including any additional evidence he or she provides in support of those comments, and determine whether they merit any revision to the draft investigation report. OAI is not obligated to obtain comments on the draft investigation report from the investigation subject more than once, but may, at its discretion, revert to the investigation subject for clarification regarding the comments and evidence he or she presented in response to the draft investigation report.  Once the Director, OAI considers that no further revision to the draft investigation report is warranted, OAI will provide the final investigation report, together with the comments of the investigation subject and any evidence he or she may have provided, to the Director, BMS/OLS. If the investigation subject resigns or otherwise separates prior to the completion by OAI of an investigation report, at its discretion, OAI may decide to complete the investigation or finalize the investigation report notwithstanding the investigation subject’s resignation or separation: Should the investigation report be finalised, OAI will send the draft investigation report to the former staff member providing the subject an opportunity to submit his or her comments. These comments will be reviewed in accordance with the present Legal Framework, and the Director, BMS/OLS will place a letter in the former staff member’s official status file indicating whether, if the subject had remained employed: (1) a recommendation would have been made for charges of misconduct to be initiated against him or her, or (2) whether or not he or she would have been cleared of the allegations of misconduct, or (3) whether the matter would have been dealt with from a work performance standpoint, and if so how (e.g. via a letter of reprimand). The letter will also indicate whether the former staff member resigned while under investigation, or whether his or her contract expired while under investigation. The former staff member will be invited to comment on the letter, and the letter and his or her comments will be placed in his or her official status file. Should the investigation report not be finalised, the Director, BMS/OLS will place a letter in the former staff member’s official status file, indicating that he or she: (1) resigned or, (2) his or her contract expired while under investigation. In both instances, the former staff member will be given an opportunity to present comments, and the letter and his or her comments will be placed in his or her official status file. If the subject transfers, or otherwise separates and accepts a position at the UN Secretariat or an Agency, Fund or Programme of the UN prior to the completion of the investigation report, the Director, OAI may decide to transfer the matter to that UN entity. If the subject of an investigation resigns or otherwise separates from service after the issuance of an investigation report but prior to the initiation of disciplinary proceedings through the issuance of a charge letter, upon review of the investigation report and the comments of the subject thereon, the Director BMS/OLS may decide to place a letter in the former staff member’s official status file indicating whether, if he or she had remained employed: (1) a recommendation would have been made for charges of misconduct to be initiated against him or her, or (2) whether or not he or she would have been cleared of the allegations of misconduct, or (3) whether the matter would have been dealt with from a work performance standpoint, and if so how (e.g. via a letter of reprimand). The letter will also indicate whether the former staff member resigned or otherwise separated following an investigation. The former staff member will be invited to comment on the letter, and the letter and his or her comments will be placed in his or her official status file. If the subject transfers, or otherwise separates and accepts a position at the UN Secretariat or an Agency, Fund or Programme of the UN, the Director, BMS/OLS may decide to transfer the matter to that UN entity. The foregoing is without prejudice to the fact that in accordance with the UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation, OAI will forward the report of an investigation that was conducted based on a prima facie finding of the Director, Ethics Office, to the Director, Ethics Office, without obtaining prior comment on the report by the subject of the investigation. However, any staff members alleged to be responsible for retaliation will enjoy the same rights as other subjects of investigation, including, consistent with the procedures for investigation, the ability to comment on any draft investigation report concerning allegations against them as the investigation subject.  CHAPTER III  PROCEDURES FOLLOWING INVESTIGATION  Section 1 - Actions following receipt of the final investigation report by BMS/OLS   Upon receipt and analysis by BMS/OLS of the final investigation report and the comments of the subject of the investigation on the draft investigation report, including any additional evidence he or she may have provided, the Director, BMS/OLS, may request that OAI or the subject of the investigation provide further clarification or verification prior to making a recommendation on the next course of action.  On the basis of a review of the final investigation report, and any comments and evidence presented by the investigation subject thereon, as well as any additional clarification or verification by OAI or the subject of the investigation, the Director, BMS/OLS, may recommend the following actions to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS:   1.1 - Charges of misconduct   If the Director, BMS/OLS considers that the facts indicate that misconduct occurred, he or she will recommend that the staff member be formally charged with misconduct.  The charge letter initiates the disciplinary proceedings. In that letter (which will attach the final investigation report and the comments of the subject of the investigation on the draft investigation report, including any additional evidence he or she may have provided) the staff member is notified in writing of the formal charges (which at his or her request may be translated into the working language of his or her duty station), and be given a specified period of time (normally at least ten (10) working days) to answer the charges and produce countervailing evidence, if any. The staff member will also be notified of his or her right to counsel to assist in his or her defence, and be informed as to how to obtain the assistance of the Office of Staff Legal Assistance (see Chapter IV, Section 4). The investigation subject may present a request to the Director, BMS/OLS, that he or she be granted access to files, provided that he or she justifies that they are relevant to his or her response. A copy of the charge letter signed by the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS may be given for information to the Resident Representative, Head of Office/Unit/Section/ Department/Bureau, or the Executive Director of the Organization to which the staff member is assigned. The Director, BMS/OLS, may, on an exceptional basis, grant an extension to the staff member to respond to the charges of misconduct. Any request by the staff member should be accompanied by specific reasons for such an extension. If the investigation subject resigns or otherwise separates from service after the initiation of disciplinary proceedings but prior to the completion of the case and imposition of a disciplinary sanction, the Director, BMS/OLS may nevertheless decide to proceed, and seek to obtain the comments of the subject or consider the comments already received as appropriate. Upon receipt of the comments of the subject or an indication that the subject does not wish to provide comments or if the subject does not provide comments within the prescribed period, the Director, BMS/OLS  may conclude the matter as follows: The Director, BMS/OLS may determine that, if the subject had remained a staff member, a recommendation would have been made to impose disciplinary sanctions on the subject. The Director BMS/OLS may place a letter to this effect on the subject’s official status file. The letter will also indicate that the subject resigned or otherwise separated from service following the issuance of a charge letter. The subject will be invited to comment on the letter, and his or her comments will be attached to the letter from the Director BMS/OLS to be placed in his or her official status file; or The Director, BMS/OLS may determine that, had the subject remained a staff member, a recommendation would have been made to exonerate the subject without further consequences, or to exonerate the subject and treat the matter as a performance issue. In such a case, such a recommendation will be made to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS who may formally and fully exonerate the subject or exonerate the subject and issue a reprimand. Should the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS determine that the subject should not be exonerated, the matter will proceed as in (a); or If the subject transfers, or otherwise separates and accepts a position at the UN Secretariat or an Agency, Fund or Programme of the UN, the Director, BMS/OLS may decide to transfer the matter to that UN entity; or Otherwise close the matter without further action. 1.2 - Clearance from the allegations of wrongdoing  If the Director, BMS/OLS considers that the allegations are not substantiated or the facts do not warrant disciplinary action, he or she will recommend to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS:  That the staff member be notified in writing that they have been cleared of the allegations of wrongdoing, and that the matter be closed; OAI and the Resident Representative, Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau, or the Executive Director of the Organization to which the staff member is assigned, will be informed of such notification;  If the staff member was placed on administrative leave, that the administrative leave be discontinued and that the staff member be authorized to resume his or her duties; and That documents related to the investigation be expunged from the staff member’s official status file, except those referred to in Chapter III, Section 1, Subsection 1.3. The staff member will be notified in writing as soon as feasible of the decision of the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS concerning his or her exoneration.  1.3 - Work performance related issues  While the Director, BMS/OLS may recommend that the subject be cleared of the allegations of wrongdoing, he or she may determine that the conduct depicted in the final investigation report as received by BMS/OLS and the circumstances of the case have shown unsatisfactory performance and/or poor judgement not amounting to misconduct on the part of the staff member. In such a case, the Director, BMS/OLS may recommend that: An oral reprimand or letter of reprimand be issued by the Assistant Administrator and Director, Bureau for Management Services. In such an instance, further or additional comments on the basis of the reprimand do not need to be obtained provided the staff member has had the opportunity to comment on the facts and circumstances on which the reprimand is based (such as by being provided an opportunity to comment on the draft investigation report); and/or  The final investigation report (or extracts thereof) with the staff member’s comments thereon, be included in the annual Performance Management and Development (PMD) of the staff member; and/or An appropriate training course be undertaken by the staff member. 1.4 - Timeframe  To the extent possible, depending on the complexity of a case and the availability of investigative resources, the period between the date the allegations of wrongdoing are reported to OAI and the completion of the investigation should not normally exceed 270 working days. The timeframe from receipt of the final investigation report by BMS/OLS to the finalization of the case should not normally exceed 180 working days.    CHAPTER IV  DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS   The dispatch of a letter outlining the legal charges of misconduct against the subject initiates disciplinary proceedings. Disciplinary proceedings cannot proceed until the subject has been provided with such a letter. Upon receipt of the subject’s comments to the charges, the Director, BMS/OLS will consider whether the subject’s conduct constitutes misconduct within the meaning of Staff Rule 10.1, or whether the subject has given a satisfactory account of his or her behaviour and should be exonerated of the charges of misconduct. In the latter case, the Director, BMS/OLS may also consider whether the circumstances indicate the need to address the conduct of the subject as a performance issue. Should the Director, BMS/OLS consider that the subject’s conduct constitutes misconduct, he or she will make a recommendation to the Administrator with a copy to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS as to the appropriate measure or measures, taking into account, inter alia, relevant case law and precedents. Where the Director, BMS/OLS considers that the subject has given a satisfactory account of his or her behaviour and the subject’s conduct does not rise to the level of misconduct, the Director, BMS/OLS makes a recommendation to this effect to the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS, who has authority to decide on the exoneration of a subject of allegations of misconduct. Section 1 - Disciplinary measures  In accordance with Staff Rule 10.2 (a), where the subject’s conduct constitutes misconduct, the Administrator or Associate Administrator may impose one or more of the following disciplinary measures on the subject, depending on the nature and gravity of the misconduct in question: Written censure; Loss of one or more steps in grade; Deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for salary increment; Suspension without pay for a specified period; Fine; Deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for consideration for promotion; Demotion with deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for consideration for promotion; Separation from service, with notice or compensation in lieu of notice, notwithstanding Staff Rule 9.7, and with or without termination indemnity pursuant to paragraph (c) of Annex III to the Staff Regulations; Dismissal.   Annex I to the present document specifies the effects of each of the above-mentioned measures.  The Administrator or Associate Administrator will notify the subject of the decision to impose a disciplinary sanction in writing. The Director, BMS/OHR and the Resident Representative, Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau, or the Executive Director of the Organization to which the subject is assigned, will also be informed of such notification. A copy of the decision will be placed on the subject’s official status file. Section 2 – Exoneration and Non-disciplinary measures Where the conduct of the subject is not considered to rise to the level of misconduct, the subject is exonerated of the allegations of misconduct. The decision of the Assistant Administrator and Director, BMS to that effect will be provided in writing to the subject. The Director, BMS/OHR and the Resident Representative, Head of Office/Unit/Section/Department/Bureau, or the Executive Director of the Organization to which the subject is assigned, will also be informed of such a decision. Notwithstanding the exoneration of the subject of allegations of misconduct, the conduct of the subject may require other administrative action and/or measures. These do not constitute disciplinary sanctions. Under Staff Rule 10.2 (b), the following measures are not considered to be disciplinary measures: Written or oral reprimand; Recovery of monies owed to the Organization; Administrative leave with or without pay pursuant to Staff Rule 10.4. Other measures may be taken such as recovery of monies from the subject as a result of a failure to comply with his or her private legal obligations in accordance with the findings of a competent court, specific training to improve or further develop certain skills or the temporary reassignment to different, but equivalent-level, functions. Such measures do not constitute a disciplinary measure. The recovery for any financial loss attributable to the staff member’s conduct, including gross negligence or recklessness pursuant to Staff Rule 10.1 (b) may be pursued in addition to the imposition of disciplinary measures (see Chapter IV, Section 5, Subsection 5.3). Section 3 - Appeal against a disciplinary measure to the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal  Within ninety (90) calendar days of being informed of the decision taken in his or her case, a subject against whom a disciplinary or non-disciplinary measure has been imposed following the completion of the disciplinary proceedings, may submit an application to the United Nations Dispute Tribunal, in accordance with Chapter XI of the Staff Rules. A staff member or the Organization may appeal against a decision or judgement of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal to the United Nations Appeals Tribunal within sixty (60) calendar days from the issuance of the judgement on grounds set out in Staff Rule 11.5.  Section 4 - Counsel to staff member  Representation by Counsel is permitted once the staff member is charged with misconduct and during disciplinary proceedings.    4.1 - Office of Staff Legal Assistance, United Nations  A staff member, who wishes to obtain the assistance of the Office of Staff Legal Assistance, may contact this Office at e-mail: osla@un.org, or telephone number: (+1) 212- 963-3957.   4.2 - External counsel  Alternatively, if a staff member chooses to secure Counsel from outside the Office of Staff Legal Assistance, it will be at his or her own expense (see Staff Rule 10.3 (a)).  Section 5 - Miscellaneous  5.1 - Publication of disciplinary decisions  In the interests of transparency, the Administrator will inform the UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS Executive Board of disciplinary decisions taken in the course of the preceding year, and publish an annual report of cases of misconduct (without the individuals’ names) that have resulted in the imposition of disciplinary measures. Such report will be circulated to all staff.  5.2 - Local authorities  It should be noted that the Organization is obligated to refer credible allegations of violations of national law to the country of nationality of the staff member. Referral may also be made to the national authorities in the country where the events in question took place. Such referral will usually occur following disciplinary proceedings, but may occur at any time that credible allegations are considered to arise.  Staff members may not report any matters to local authorities except in the case of compelling emergency or an imminent threat or danger, after which the matter will be immediately reported to BMS/OLS. Otherwise, any such matters must first be reported to BMS/OLS. Bringing a matter to the attention of local authorities requires the concurrence of the UN Office of Legal Affairs (UN/OLA) since it, inter alia, implicates the privileges and immunities of the Organization.  5.3 - Recovery for Loss of Property or Assets  Under Staff Rule 10.1 (b), “Where the staff member’s failure to comply with his or her obligations or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant is determined by the Secretary-General to constitute misconduct, such staff member may be required to reimburse the United Nations either partially or in full for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of his or her actions, if such actions are determined to be willful, reckless, or grossly negligent.”  Pursuant to that Rule, UNDP will pursue recovery for any financial loss attributable to the staff member’s misconduct (fraud, theft), or gross negligence, or recklessness, in the management of funds.  Such recovery action does not constitute a disciplinary measure (see Staff Rule 10.2 (b)) and is distinct from any disciplinary action being considered or undertaken.   ANNEX I:  EFFECTS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF DISCIPLINARY MEASURES  The following disciplinary measures may be taken into account when assessing the staff member’s performance.  Written censure  A written censure is a letter indicating that the staff member has committed wrongdoing. The written censure is placed in the staff member’s official status file and becomes part of his or her permanent record.  Loss of one or more steps-in-grade  Loss of steps-in-grade means that the staff member’s level within grade is reduced by the number of steps specified in the decision. As a result, the staff member loses any accrued period of service within the year the decision is implemented. He or she will be eligible for subsequent in-grade increments on the anniversary date of the implementation of the disciplinary decision.  In the event that the number of steps to be lost is greater than the staff member’s current step, he or she is placed at the lowest step on the salary scale for his or her grade, and remains at that step for the number of years by which the decision exceeds the number of steps available before receiving the next increment on the scale.   Deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for salary increment  Deferment of eligibility for salary increment means that for the stated time period of the deferment, the staff member’s step is frozen, and, for that period, he or she does not accrue any time to be credited towards eligibility for the next salary increment. In this instance, the anniversary date upon which the staff member would be eligible for the next salary increment is postponed for a period of time corresponding to the length of the deferment, and all future anniversary dates upon which the staff member becomes eligible for salary increments will change accordingly. Any period of service occurring between the date of the staff member’s last salary increment and the implementation date of the deferment measure will be credited towards the staff member’s next salary increment.        Suspension without pay for a specified period  Suspension without pay means that the staff member is not permitted to serve for a specified period of time, which normally does not exceed six months, during which his or her salary and allowances are withheld and any contribution which UNDP is paying in respect of medical insurance and pension is discontinued.  Fine  The staff member is assessed a monetary penalty, the amount of which is determined in proportion to his or her annual remuneration. The fine is either paid directly by the staff member or deducted from his or her emoluments in a lump-sum or schedule of payments.   Deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for consideration for promotion  Deferment of eligibility for consideration for promotion means that for the stated time period of the deferment, the staff member cannot be considered for promotion to any posts.  Demotion with deferment, for a specified period, of eligibility for consideration for promotion  Demotion means a reduction in grade, normally the staff member’s immediate grade below, unless the decision provides for a demotion by more than one grade. Demotion is implemented as the opposite of a promotion. As a result, the staff member is placed at the equivalent step to his or her current step in the grade below his or her present grade. However, the Administrator or Associate Administrator as appropriate may vary the step level. If the demotion is effective in the month in which an increment at the higher step is due, such increment is implemented, and the above subtraction is effected on the basis of the new step.   The demotion decision will specify the period of time during which the staff member will not be eligible and considered for promotion.  The date of the next salary increment at the lower level becomes the anniversary date of the demotion.   Separation from service, with notice or compensation in lieu of notice, notwithstanding Staff Rule 9.7, and with or without termination indemnity pursuant to paragraph (c) of Annex III to the Staff Regulations  The decision will specify whether the separation from service is: with notice or compensation in lieu thereof, and  with or without termination indemnity.  The termination notice or compensation in lieu thereof, will not be less than three months for permanent appointments and continuing appointments, not less than thirty (30) days for fixed-term appointments, and not less than fifteen (15) days for temporary appointments, or such period as may be stipulated in the letter of appointment.  In lieu of the serving of the notice period, the UNDP Administrator may authorize payment of compensation on the basis of the salary and allowances which would have been payable if the date of termination had been at the end of the notice period. In such a case, all salaries, allowances and other benefits which the staff member would have received had he or she served the period of notice, are taken into account, including post adjustment, dependency allowances, special post allowances, education grant, etc. The period is counted in the calculation of terminal payments, but annual leave does not continue to accrue. The salary paid in lieu of notice is not pensionable and the period is not counted as contributory service. Unless the staff member requests that it be excluded, any contribution which UNDP is paying in respect of medical insurance is continued during the period of notice.  If the staff member is granted termination indemnity, this indemnity does not exceed half of the amount calculated pursuant to Annex III to the Staff Regulations.  Subject to the conditions of eligibility, a staff member separated from service is entitled to repatriation grant.   A staff member separated from service for misconduct is banned from any future employment and contractual opportunities with the Organization.  Dismissal  Dismissal means immediate separation from service.  A staff member who is dismissed is neither entitled to termination notice or compensation in lieu thereof, nor to any termination indemnity pursuant to Annex III to the Staff Regulations, nor to repatriation grant pursuant to Staff Rule 3.18.  A staff member who is dismissed is banned from any future employment and contractual opportunities with the Organization.  _________________      Links to Documents  The relevant documents cited in the UNDP Legal Framework for Addressing Non-compliance with UN Standards of Conduct can be accessed through the following links:  Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service  Secretary-General’s Bulletin on “Status, basic rights and duties of UN Staff Members” (ST/SGB/2016/9)   Secretary-General’s Bulletin on “Special Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse” (ST/SGB/2003/13)  UNDP Policy on Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse of Authority  UNDP Policy for Protection against Retaliation  Performance Management and Development (PMD) Policy  OAI Investigation Guidelines   ",
    "uniforms": " Uniforms    If deemed necessary, the Resident Representative (RR) may provide certain categories of custodial staff with uniforms.    The RR may provide UNDP official drivers and messengers with standard uniforms on a yearly basis, provided that staff members concerned hold a contract for a minimum period of one year.     The RR may also consider providing the similar entitlement to other categories of custodial staff, such as gardeners, night watchmen, etc., as deemed suitable to their functional responsibilities.     The procurement or the provision should be arranged by the field office. However, in no way should this entitlement be granted in the form of cash to the staff members concerned.       "
